**Appearance**: Syvander is an ancient green dragon with scales that glistens like polished metal under the sunlight.

**Personality**: Syvander was once a figure of wisdom and authority, a true ancient in every sense of the word. He was contemplative, spoke slowly, and carefully considered every word. Yet, despite his wisdom, he bore the guilt of the Day of Mourning like a heavy burden, which drove him mad.

**Backstory**: Once a respected figure among dragonkin, Syvander was duped by the [[Draconic Prophecy#^a74a88|Prophecy]], causing the [[Day of Mourning]]. Wracked with guilt, he has since secluded himself from the world, seeking a way to right his wrongs. Now, hidden away deep in the [[Mournland]], Syvander desperately experiments to find a solution. He will stop at nothing to right his wrongs, no matter who he hurts in the process.

**Motivations**: Syvander is driven by his desire to rectify his past mistakes. He seeks to quell the Chaos and restore balance. He does this through experimenting with both ancient and new forms of magic, attempting to recreate the [[Heartstone]], which he believes is lost, so he can undo his mistakes.

- Syvander is an incredibly powerful dragon with an array of breath weapons and magic at his disposal. Despite his guilt, he will not hesitate to defend himself if provoked. 
- He has no problem killing anyone who tries to stop his experiments. He is blind to their ethics, and does not take kindly to being challenged.

**Roleplay Tips**: Play Syvander as superficially proud and wise, with regret deeply ingrained into his core. He has blinded himself to his unethical and cruel experiments, and gets agitated when challenged on it, though he will freely admit the Day of Mourning was his fault.
