## Falling In Sharn

To use these tables, when a character falls from height in the City of Towers, first have them roll on the _Outcome_ table. If that entry ends with * then the DM rolls on the _Extra Effects_ table.

### Outcome

| Roll (d10) | Effect Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | The character manages to miss every obsticle on the way down, falling to the lowest point possible.*                                                                                                                                      |
| 2          | The individual crashes through a canvas awning halfway through their fall, cushioning their descent. They fall a total of 20 feet but the awning reduces the effective fall to 10 feet, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage.*                   |
| 3          | A gust of wind from a passing airship or elemental-powered vehicle pushes the individual to a nearby ledge after a 30-foot fall. The wind slows their descent, reducing the effective fall to 20 feet. They take 2d6 bludgeoning damage.* |
| 4          | The individual falls into a net or tarp set up by workers or residents after a 20-foot descent. The net slows the fall, reducing the effective fall to 10 feet. They take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.                                         |
| 6          | You fall past a flying gargoyle! Roll an acrobatics check to grab onto it. If successful, it demands payment under threat of dropping you.                                                                                                |
| 5          | The fall is significant. The individual falls 40 feet before hitting the ground or a hard surface, taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage.*                                                                                                        |
| 7          | A mage or artificer nearby notices and casts a spell or uses a device to slow the individual's descent after they've fallen 10 feet. They land softly and take no damage. Now they are asking for payment for their services.             |
| 8          | The individual falls into one of Sharn's many waterways or canals after a drop of 1d12 * 10 feet. The water cushions their fall, reducing the effective fall distance by 50 feet.                                                         |
| 9          | The fall is long and harrowing. The individual falls 100 feet before making a hard impact, taking 10d6 bludgeoning damage.*                                                                                                               |
| 10         | Roll again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 91-100     | The ground is enchanted with _Featherfall_.
