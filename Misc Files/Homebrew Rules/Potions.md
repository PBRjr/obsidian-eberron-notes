Potions may be used on ones self as an action or bonus action. They have differing effects depending on which is chosen.

Action:
User gains full effect from a potion, no roll needed.
Ex.: drinking one potion of healing as an action will heal the user 10 hp.

Bonus action:
User rolls potion as normal.
Ex.: drinking one potion of healing will heal the user 2d4+2 hp.

Using the potion on someone else still requires an action, and requires a roll to determine healing as normal.
