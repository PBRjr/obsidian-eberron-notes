Skill challenges are a way to handle complex situations where you need to use a variety of skills to succeed. The goal is to achieve x successes before you get x failures.

1. **Success vs. Failure:** You need x successes to succeed in the challenge. If you get x failures before that, you fail the challenge.
2. **Proficiency:** You can only use skills you're proficient in.
3. **Unique Skills:** You canâ€™t use the same skill twice in this challenge.
4. **Creative Solutions:** Besides what was just stated, there's no limit to what skills you can use, as long as you have a reasonable explanation for how the skill helps you in the situation.

**Aid:** You can aid another player's check, but this is limited to once per player per challenge. You must be proficient in the skill you're using to aid, and it must logically make sense. Any number of players may aid a single skill check. To grant aid, make a skill check, and take the modifier value (MV = (total - 10) / 2 )) of the total roll and subtract/add it to the DC of the original skill check.

- Procedure:
	- DM tells the players they are entering a skill challenge and explains the rules.
	- DM describes a scenario and typically restates the goal of the challenge - escaping a crumbling tower, rescuing people from a burning building, chasing down a suspect - then describes the obstacles the party faces as they navigate the scenario.
	- Narration is typically carried out in a montage style.
	- The players will propose a skill they want to make the check with and describe how it would clear the current obstacle.
	- They make the check, the DM describes how they pass/fail, then the cycle repeats until the success/failure condition is met.
