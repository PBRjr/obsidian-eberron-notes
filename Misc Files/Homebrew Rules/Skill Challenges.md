Skill challenges
- 5 successes vs 3 failures
- Players can only make checks with skills they are proficient in
- Players can only make a check with skills they have not used previously
- There are no limits to what skills may be used for what situations, as long as the player has a reasonable explanation for how a skill would help them succeed.
- **Aid.** Once/player/skill challenge a player may aid another players skill check. They may only do so if they are proficient in the skill they are using to aid, and if they pass a skill check with that skill. Success grants the original player advantage on their skill check.

- Procedure:
	- DM tells the players they are entering a skill challenge and explains the rules.
	- DM describes a scenario and typically restates the goal of the challenge - escaping a crumbling tower, rescuing people from a burning building, chasing down a suspect - then describes the obstacles the party faces as they navigate the scenario.
	- Narration is typically carried out in a montage style.
	- The players will propose a skill they want to make the check with and describe how it would clear the current obstacle.
	- They make the check, the DM describes how they pass/fail, then the cycle repeats until the success/failure condition is met.
