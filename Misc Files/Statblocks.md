**Hardened by Flame.** When the hellhound is subjected to fire damage, they take no damage. Instead, their skin darkens and hardens, and their AC increases to 18 until the end of their next turn.

**Keen Smell.** The hellhound has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track other creatures and on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide from creatures who are unaware of their presence.

![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

*Actions*

**Hellish Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) fire damage.

**Hellfire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The hellhound exhales flame in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (3d6 + 4) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that isn't a hellhound who fails the saving throw is also on fire for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn), or until the target or another creature who can reach them uses an action to extinguish the flames. A creature who is on fire at the start of their turn takes 7 (2d6) fire damage. If a creature who is already on fire is set on fire again on a subsequent turn, the damage isn't cumulative, but the duration of the fire resets to 1 minute.

**Pack Tactics.** When an enemy within 5 feet of the hellhound hits the hellhound with a melee attack, the hound can make a Hellish Bite attack against that enemy. If the hound's attack hits, the enemy is also grappled (escape DC 12), and if the triggering attack was a weapon attack, the weapon used in the triggering attack can't be used to make any more attacks while the target is grappled. The grapple ends if the hound attacks a different target with Hellish Bite.

A creature who is on fire at the start of their turn takes fire damage equal to the number of curs who joined the attack.

**Electric Gauntlets.** The Brawler's fists are outfitted with electric gauntlets that deal an additional 2d6 lightning damage on a hit and allow them to make ranged attacks.

**Heavy Armor Master.** The Brawler reduces any non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage they take by 3 due to heavy armor plating.

**Boosters.** The Brawler can fly and hover thanks to boosters installed in its legs.
 ![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)
*Actions***

_Multiattack._ The Brawler makes two attacks using Grab, Haymaker, or Electric Arc.

_Grab._ Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the brawler can't grab another creature.

_Throw._ The brawler throws one Medium or smaller creature they are grappling or object they are holding up to 30 feet horizontally. If the thrown target is a creature, they fall prone after this throw. If the thrown target would enter the space of a creature or solid object that is no more than one size smaller than it, the thrown target collides with it and stops in the nearest unoccupied space, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. A Large or smaller creature hit by this thrown target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same amount of damage and fall prone.

_Electric Arc._ Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d8+ 3) lightning damage.

**Blind.** The giant cannot see and is immune to any effect that would require sight. It has blindsight out to 60 feet due to its acute hearing.

**Keen Hearing.** The giant has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

**Plague Carrier.** When a creature starts its turn within 10 feet of the giant, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned this way, the creature takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Water Weakness.** While in direct contact with water, any attacks against the Plague Giant are made with advantage, and the Plague Giant makes all attacks and saving throws with disadvantage.

_**Actions**_

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two slam attacks or uses Devastating Charge once.

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12(2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) necrotic damage.

**Devastating Charge.** The giant moves up to its speed in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature or object, treating walls and similar barriers as difficult terrain. Each creature in its path must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. Any walls or barriers in its path take 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage.

![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

**Phase 2: Rampage.** The giant can use Devastating Charge twice, choosing a different direction for each charge.

**Phase 3: Plague Eruption.** The giant's body violently expels disease in all directions. Each creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and become poisoned until the end of their next turn. Additionally, the area becomes filled with diseased fog until the end of the giant's next turn, heavily obscuring it for all creatures except the giant.

_**Reaction**_  
![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

**Sound Stalker.** When a creature within 60 feet makes a sound (including speaking or casting a spell with verbal components), the giant can immediately move up to half its speed toward that creature without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Molten Flesh.** The first time a creature other than a fire giant touches the red fist or hits them with a melee attack on a turn, that creature takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.

***Actions***

*Actions*

_**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8+ 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the Ankheg can bite only the [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.

_**Acid Spray (Recharge 6).**_ The Ankheg spits acid up to 30 ft away, creating a 10 ft/10 ft large pool, provided that it has no creature [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled). Each creature in the area when it lands or at the start of its turn must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

*Villain Actions*
***Bloody Rage.*** When reduced to half of it's health or less, the Ankheg lashes out in a rage, causing acid to seep from its pores. The area immediately surrounding it becomes covered. Then, the Ankheg burrows underground, avoiding attacks of opportunity, and can move up to 10 ft.

***Acid Pores.*** When the Ankheg takes damage from a melee weapon attack while its under the effects of *Bloody Rage*, the attacker makes a DC 11 (10 + CON) strength check. On a fail, the attacker's weapon becomes lodged in the Ankheg's body long enough for its acid to destroy parts of the weapon, turning it into an improvised weapon.

**Shapechanger**: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Ambusher**: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it surprised.

*Actions*

**Multiattack**: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.

**Slam**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Read Thoughts**: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.
