Languages understands Common and Infernal but can't speak

Challenge 3 (700 XP)

![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

**Hardened by Flame.** When the hellhound is subjected to fire damage, they take no damage. Instead, their skin darkens and hardens, and their AC increases to 18 until the end of their next turn.

**Keen Smell.** The hellhound has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track other creatures and on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide from creatures who are unaware of their presence.

![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

*Actions*

**Hellish Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) fire damage.

**Hellfire Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The hellhound exhales flame in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (3d6 + 4) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that isn't a hellhound who fails the saving throw is also on fire for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn), or until the target or another creature who can reach them uses an action to extinguish the flames. A creature who is on fire at the start of their turn takes 7 (2d6) fire damage. If a creature who is already on fire is set on fire again on a subsequent turn, the damage isn't cumulative, but the duration of the fire resets to 1 minute.

**Pack Tactics.** When an enemy within 5 feet of the hellhound hits the hellhound with a melee attack, the hound can make a Hellish Bite attack against that enemy. If the hound's attack hits, the enemy is also grappled (escape DC 12), and if the triggering attack was a weapon attack, the weapon used in the triggering attack can't be used to make any more attacks while the target is grappled. The grapple ends if the hound attacks a different target with Hellish Bite.

On a failed save, the target is lit on fire and must make a save at the end of each of their turns (save ends at end of turn), or until the target or another creature who can reach them uses an action to extinguish the flames. A creature who is on fire at the start of their turn takes fire damage equal to the number of curs who joined the attack.

_Multiattack._ The Brawler makes two attacks using Grab, Haymaker, or Electric Arc.

*Actions*

_**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8+ 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the Ankheg can bite only the [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled) creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.

_**Acid Spray (Recharge 6).**_ The Ankheg spits acid up to 30 ft away, creating a 10 ft/10 ft large pool, provided that it has no creature [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Grappled). Each creature in the area when it lands or at the start of its turn must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

*Villain Actions*
***Bloody Rage.*** When reduced to half of it's health or less, the Ankheg lashes out in a rage, causing acid to seep from its pores. The area immediately surrounding it becomes covered. Then, the Ankheg burrows underground, avoiding attacks of opportunity, and can move up to 10 ft.

***Acid Pores.*** When the Ankheg takes damage from a melee weapon attack while its under the effects of *Bloody Rage*, the attacker makes a DC 11 (10 + CON) strength check. On a fail, the attacker's weapon becomes lodged in the Ankheg's body long enough for its acid to destroy parts of the weapon, turning it into an improvised weapon.

**Shapechanger**: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Ambusher**: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it surprised.

**Surprise Attack**: If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.

![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

*Actions*

**Multiattack**: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.

**Slam**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Read Thoughts**: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.
