# Actions

## Activate an Item
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 141. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)_

- **Duration**: 1 action

Activating some magic items requires a user to do something in particular, such as holding the item and uttering a command word, reading the item if it is a scroll, or drinking it if it is a potion. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules related to their activation.

If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the [Use an Object](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, so a feature such as the rogue's Fast Hands can't be used to activate the item.

### Command Word

A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken audibly for the item to operate. A magic item that requires the user to speak a command word can't be activated in the area of any effect that prevents sound, such as the area created by the silence spell.

### Consumables

Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer functions.

### Spells

Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item, often by expending charges from it. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires [concentration](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration). Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.

Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of the spell and confer the spell's effects. Such an item still uses the spell's duration unless the item's description says otherwise.

A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability—perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature—your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.

### Charges

Some magic items have charges that you expend to activate its properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on the item, or when a creature attunes to the item. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to that item learns how many charges it regained.

## Attack
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 361_

- **Duration**: 1 action

When you take the Attack action, you can make one attack roll with a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb.md).

### Equipping and Unequipping Weapons

You can either equip or unequip one weapon when you make an attack as part of this action. You do so either before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon before an attack, you don't need to use it for that attack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon includes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.

### Moving Between Attacks

If you move on your turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack action, you can use some or all of that movement to move between those attacks.

## Climb onto a Bigger Creature
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 271_

- **Duration**: 1 action

If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by <span title="Player's Handbook">grappling</span>. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.

As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check contested by the target's Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

This action is an optional addition to the game, from the optional/variant rule [Action Options](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/action-options.md).

## Dash
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 365_

- **Duration**: 1 action

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your [Speed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) after applying any modifiers. With a [Speed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your [Speed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash.

If you have a special speed, such as a [Fly Speed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) or [Swim Speed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md), you can use that speed instead of your [Speed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) when you take this action. You choose which speed to use each time you take it.

## Disarm
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 271_

- **Duration**: 1 action

A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

See also: [Attack](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack)

This action is an optional addition to the game, from the optional/variant rule [Action Options](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/action-options.md).

## Disengage
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366_

- **Duration**: 1 action

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke [Opportunity Attacks](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack) for the rest of the current turn.

## Dodge
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366_

- **Duration**: 1 action

lf you take the Dodge action, you gain the following benefits: until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has [Disadvantage](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity [saving throws](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb.md) with [Advantage](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md).

You lose these benefits if you have the [Incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition or if your [Speed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is 0.

## Don or Doff a Shield
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 219. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

- **Duration**: 1 action

A [Shield](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/shield-xphb.md) can be donned or doffed as an action.

## End Concentration
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

- **Duration**: Free

Some spells and other effects require Concentration to remain active, as specified in their descriptions. You can end Concentration at any time (no action required).

## Escape a Grapple
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 367. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

- **Duration**: 1 action

A Grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check against the grapple's escape DC, ending the [condition](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/condition-xphb.md) on itself on a success. The [condition](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/condition-xphb.md) also ends if the grappler has the [Incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition or if the distance between the Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grapple's range.

## Healing Surge
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 266_

- **Duration**: 1 action

As an action, a character can use a healing surge and spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

A character who uses a healing surge can't do so again until he or she finishes a short or long rest. Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level divided by four (minimum of one dice).

This action is an optional addition to the game, from the optional/variant rule [Healing](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/healing.md).

## Help
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 368_

- **Duration**: 1 action

When you take the Help action, you do one of the following.

### Assist an Ability Check

Choose one of your skill or tool proficiencies and one ally who is near enough for you to assist verbally or physically when they make an ability check. That ally has [Advantage](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on the next ability check they make with the chosen skill or tool. This benefit expires if the ally doesn't use it before the start of your next turn. The DM has final say on whether your assistance is possible.

### Assist an Attack Roll

You momentarily distract an enemy within 5 feet of you, giving [Advantage](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) to the next attack roll by one of your allies against that enemy. This benefit expires at the start of your next turn.

## Hide
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 368_

- **Duration**: 1 action

With the Hide action, you try to conceal yourself. To do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity ([Stealth](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check while you're [Heavily Obscured](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md) or behind [Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md), and you must be out of any enemy's line of sight; if you can see a creature, you can discern whether it can see you.

On a successful check, you have the [Invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) condition. Make note of your check's total, which is the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom ([Perception](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

The condition ends on you immediately after any of the following occurs: you make a sound louder than a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.

## Improvising an Action
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 15. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

- **Duration**: Varies

Player characters and monsters can also do things not covered by other actions. Many class features and other abilities provide additional action options, and you can improvise other actions. When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the Dungeon Master tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of [D20 Test](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md) you need to make, if any.

## Influence
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 369_

- **Duration**: 1 action

With the Influence action, you urge a monster to do something. Describe or roleplay how you're communicating with the monster. Are you trying to deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The DM then determines whether the monster feels willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction; this determination establishes whether an ability check is necessary, as explained below.

### Willing

If your urging aligns with the monster's desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster fulfills your request in a way it prefers.

### Unwilling

If your urging is repugnant to the monster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is necessary; it doesn't comply.

### Hesitant

If you urge the monster to do something that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability check, which is affected by the monster's attitude: Indifferent, Friendly, or Hostile, each of which is defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks table suggests which ability check to make based on how you're interacting with the monster. The GM chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to 15 or the monster's Intelligence score, whichever is higher. On a successful check, the monster does as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours (or a duration set by the DM) before urging it in the same way again.

**Influence Checks**

| Ability Check | Interaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| Charisma ([Deception](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) | Deceiving a monster that understands you |
| Charisma ([Intimidation](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) | Intimidating a monster |
| Charisma ([Performance](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)) | Amusing a monster |
| Charisma ([Persuasion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) | Persuading a monster that understands you |
| Wisdom ([Animal Handling](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) | Gently coaxing a Beast or Monstrosity |
^influence-checks

## Magic
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 371_

- **Duration**: 1 action

When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action or use a feature or magic item that requires a Magic action to be activated.

If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the Magic action on each turn of that casting, and you must maintain [Concentration](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) while you do so. If your [Concentration](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot.

## Mark
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 271_

This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.

When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition or the [shocking grasp](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/shocking-grasp-xphb.md) spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.

See also: [Attack](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack)

This action is an optional addition to the game, from the optional/variant rule [Action Options](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/action-options.md).

## Opportunity Attack
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 371_

- **Duration**: 1 reaction

You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach using its action, its [Bonus Action](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), its [Reaction](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md), or one of its speeds. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a [Reaction](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to make one melee attack with a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb.md) against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.

## Other Activity
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 190. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)_

- **Duration**: Varies

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The DM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.

> [!note] Interacting with Objects Around You
> 
> Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:
> 
> - draw or sheathe a sword  
> - open or close a door  
> - withdraw a potion from your backpack  
> - pick up a dropped axe  
> - take a bauble from a table  
> - remove a ring from your finger  
> - stuff some food into your mouth  
> - plant a banner in the ground  
> - fish a few coins from your belt pouch  
> - drink all the ale in a flagon  
> - throw a lever or a switch  
> - pull a torch from a sconce  
> - take a book from a shelf you can reach  
> - extinguish a small flame  
> - don a mask  
> - pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head  
> - put your ear to a door  
> - kick a small stone  
> - turn a key in a lock  
> - tap the floor with a 10-foot pole  
> - hand an item to another character

## Overrun
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 272_

- **Duration**: 1 action, 1 bonus

When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

See also: [Tumble](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Tumble)

This action is an optional addition to the game, from the optional/variant rule [Action Options](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/action-options.md).

## Ready
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372_

- **Duration**: 1 action

You take the Ready action to wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a [Reaction](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your [Reaction](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md). Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your [Speed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) in response to it. Examples include "If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it," and "If the zombie steps next to me, I move away."

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your [Reaction](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (expending any resources used to cast it) but hold its energy, which you release with your [Reaction](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding on to the spell's magic requires [Concentration](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration), which you can maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your [Concentration](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

## Search
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373_

- **Duration**: 1 action

When you take the Search action, you make a Wisdom check to discern something that isn't obvious. The Search table suggests which skills are applicable when you take this action, depending on what you're trying to detect.

**Search**

| Skill | Thing to Detect |
|-------|-----------------|
| [Insight](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight) | Creature's state of mind |
| [Medicine](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine) | Creature's ailment or cause of death |
| [Perception](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception) | Concealed creature or object |
| [Survival](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival) | Tracks or food |
^search

## Shove Aside
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 272_

- **Duration**: 1 action

With this option, a creature uses the special <span title="Player's Handbook">shove</span> attack from the "Player's Handbook" to force a target to the side, rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check when it does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.

This action is an optional addition to the game, from the optional/variant rule [Action Options](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/action-options.md).

## Study
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 375_

- **Duration**: 1 action

When you take the Study action, you make an Intelligence check to study your memory, a book, a clue, or another source of knowledge and call to mind an important piece of information about it.

The Areas of Knowledge table suggests which skills are applicable to various areas of knowledge.

**Areas of Knowledge**

| Skill | Areas |
|-------|-------|
| [Arcana](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) | Spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, planes of existence, and certain creatures (Aberrations, Constructs, Elementals, Fey, and Monstrosities) |
| [History](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#History) | Historic events and people, ancient civilizations, wars, and certain creatures (Giants and Humanoids) |
| [Investigation](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation) | Traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry |
| [Nature](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature) | Terrain, flora, weather, and certain creatures (Beasts, Dragons, Oozes, and Plants) |
| [Religion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion) | Deities, religious hierarchies and rites, holy symbols, cults, and certain creatures (Celestials, Fiends, and Undead) |
^areas-of-knowledge

## Tumble
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 272_

- **Duration**: 1 action, 1 bonus

A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

See also: [Overrun](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Overrun)

This action is an optional addition to the game, from the optional/variant rule [Action Options](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/action-options.md).

## Two-Weapon Fighting
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 213. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_

- **Duration**: 1 bonus

When you take the [Attack](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a [Bonus Action](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a [Shortsword](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/shortsword-xphb.md) in one hand and a [Dagger](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/dagger-xphb.md) in the other using the [Attack](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action and a [Bonus Action](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the [Bonus Action](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) unless that modifier is negative.

See also: [Attack](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack)

## Utilize
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377_

- **Duration**: 1 action

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of the [Attack](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action. When an object requires an action for its use, you take the Utilize action.
