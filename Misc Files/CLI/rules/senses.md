# Senses

## Blindsight
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 361_

If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific range without relying on physical sight. Within that range, you can see anything that isn't behind [Total Cover](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) even if you have the [Blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition or are in [Darkness](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md). Moreover, in that range, you can see something that has the [Invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

## Darkvision
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 365_

If you have Darkvision, you can see in [Dim Light](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) within a specified range as if it were [Bright Light](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) and in [Darkness](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) within that range as if it were [Dim Light](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md). You discern colors in that [Darkness](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) only as shades of gray.

## Soulsight
_Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 56_

Demons have a special sense called soulsight, allowing them to perceive each creature, other than Constructs and Undead, within a certain radius. Soulsight doesn't rely on sight but counts as "seeing" for features that require sight. Neither physical objects (including total cover) nor supernatural effects can impede soulsight unless otherwise stated. A demon's stat block lists the radius of their soulsight under "Senses."

## Tremorsense
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377_

A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.

Tremorsense can't detect creatures or objects in the air, and it doesn't count as a form of sight.

## Truesight
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377_

If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following:

- **Darkness.** You can see in normal and magical [Darkness](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md).  
- **Invisibility.** You see creatures and objects that have the [Invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) condition.  
- **Visual Illusions.** Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on [saving throws](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb.md) against them.  
- **Transformations.** You discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.  
- **Ethereal Plane.** You see into the Ethereal Plane.
