**Sylvan Forest Encounters**

| d12 + d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 2 | 1 [displacer beast](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md) |
| 3 | 1 [gnoll pack lord](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll-pack-lord.md) and `2d4` [gnolls](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) |
| 4 | `1d4` [gnolls](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) and `2d4` [hyenas](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/hyena.md) |
| 5 | A grove of burned trees. Characters searching the area and succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Survival](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check find [gnoll](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) tracks. Following the tracks for `1d4` hours leads to an encounter with [gnolls](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md), or the discovery of dead [gnolls](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) with elven arrows sticking out of their flea-ridden corpses. |
| 6 | 1 [giant owl](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-owl.md) |
| 7 | An ivy-covered statue of an elven deity or hero. |
| 8 | 1 [dryad](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) (50%) or `1d4` [satyrs](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) (50%) |
| 9 | `1d4` [centaurs](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/centaur.md) |
| 10 | `2d4` [scouts](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) (elves). One [scout](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) carries a horn and can use its action to blow it. If the horn is blown within the forest, roll on this table again. If the result indicates a monster encounter, the indicated monster or monsters arrive in `1d4` minutes. New arrivals other than [gnolls](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md), [hyenas](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/hyena.md), [owlbears](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md), and [displacer beasts](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md) are friendly toward the [scouts](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md). |
| 11 | `2d4` [pixies](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) (50%) or `2d4` [sprites](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fey/sprite-xmm.md) (50%) |
| 12 | 1 [owlbear](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md) |
| 13 | `1d4` [elks](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/elk-xmm.md) (75%) or 1 [giant elk](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-elk.md) (25%) |
| 14 | `1d4` [blink dogs](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fey/blink-dog.md) |
| 15 | A magical plant with `2d4` glowing berries. A creature that ingests a berry becomes [invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) for 1 hour, or until it attacks or casts a spell. Once picked, a berry loses its magic after 12 hours. Berries regrow at midnight, but if all its berries are picked, the plant becomes nonmagical and grows no more berries. |
| 16 | An elven tune carried on a gentle breeze |
| 17 | `1d4` [orange](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-orange.md) (75%) or [blue](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-blue.md) (25%) faerie dragons |
| 18 | 1 [druid](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) (elf). The [druid](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) is initially indifferent toward the party but becomes friendly if the characters agree to rid the forest of its gnoll infestation. |
| 19 | 1 [treant](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/plant/treant.md). The [treant](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/plant/treant.md) is friendly if the party includes one or more elves or is accompanied by a visible fey creature. The [treant](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/plant/treant.md) is hostile if the characters are carrying open flames. Otherwise, it is indifferent and doesn't announce its presence as the characters pass by. |
| 20 | 1 [unicorn](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md) |
