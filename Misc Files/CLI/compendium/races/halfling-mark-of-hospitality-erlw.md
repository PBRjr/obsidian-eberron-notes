## Traits

### Age

A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

### Size

Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

### Lucky

When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

### Brave

You have advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

### Halfling Nimbleness

You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

### Ever Hospitable

When you make a Charisma ([Persuasion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check or an ability check involving [brewer's supplies](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/brewers-supplies-xphb.md) or [cook's utensils](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/cooks-utensils-xphb.md), you can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Innkeeper's Magic

You know the [prestidigitation](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/prestidigitation-xphb.md) cantrip. You can also cast the [purify food and drink](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/purify-food-and-drink-xphb.md) and [unseen servant](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/unseen-servant-xphb.md) spells with this trait. Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Hospitality Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
