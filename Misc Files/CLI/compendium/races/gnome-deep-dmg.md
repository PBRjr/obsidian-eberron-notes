- **1/day each.** [blindness/deafness](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/blindness-deafness-xphb.md), [blur](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/blur-xphb.md), [disguise self](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/disguise-self-xphb.md)

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Gnomish, Terran, and Undercommon.
