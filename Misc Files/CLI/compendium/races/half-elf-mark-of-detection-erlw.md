## Traits

### Age

Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.

### Size

Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

### Darkvision

Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), and magic can't put you to sleep.

### Deductive Intuition

When you make an Intelligence ([Investigation](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or a Wisdom ([Insight](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check, you can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.

### Magical Detection

You can cast the [detect magic](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/detect-magic-xphb.md) and [detect poison and disease](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/detect-poison-and-disease-xphb.md) spells with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the [see invisibility](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/see-invisibility-xphb.md) spell with it. Once you cast any of these spells with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you don't require material components for them.

### Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or the Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Detection Spells table are added to the spell list of your spellcasting class.
