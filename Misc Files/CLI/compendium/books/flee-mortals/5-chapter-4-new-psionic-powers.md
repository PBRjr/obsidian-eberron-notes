# Chapter 4: New Psionic Powers
*Source: Flee, Mortals!, p. 391* 

A character playing a talent—the class found in the MCDM supplement The Talent and Psionics (https://mcdm.gg/talent)—can use the rules in that book to learn the following new powers from the creatures in this book. Powers that aren't found in The Talent and Psionics are listed in this section and indicated in a creature's stat block with an asterisk (*).

Note that some stat block powers work differently than the version for player characters presented below, usually because a creature's innate psionic ability enhances their power.
