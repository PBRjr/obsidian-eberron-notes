# Chapter 2: Environments
*Source: Flee, Mortals!, p. 292* 

Mummies lurk in tombs, but what other dangers wait in the crypt's darkness? Which monsters lurk in the enchanted forest that adventurers must cross to reach their destination? What new traits does a sewer-dwelling owlbear gain? This section presents eight typical adventure environments and a handful of creatures found within each. These environments aren't necessarily biomes, though some biomes are included here. Each environment is the kind of place the player characters might enter or pass through while seeking adventure, such as roads or swamps, or the underground world below the surface of the Mundane World.

## Environmental Features

Most of the environments in this book provide traits and lair actions you can give to creatures who live there. These traits and lair actions are designed to work with creatures of any challenge rating; as a result, they often don't use static numbers for things like damage dice and save DCs. Instead, this book sometimes calls for you to use the creature's proficiency bonus (abbreviated as PB).

For example, when a creature deals damage, they might use a number of dice equal to the creature's proficiency bonus. If a creature has a +3 proficiency bonus and their trait "deals PBd10 force damage," that's 3d10 force damage.

Similarly, when a feature requires a saving throw, the DC might add the creature's proficiency bonus. If a creature has a +3 proficiency bonus and their trait calls for a "DC 12 plus PB Dexterity saving throw," that's a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

## Cave

Some caves are simple holes in a mountainside, while others are cavernous recesses cutting through the bowels of the earth—but all are a source of fascination, fear, and adventure. As all savvy adventurers know, caves can contain treasures untold or a death most unceremonious. Beware the dark.

### Cave Traits

You can create a cave version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- [Hear the Unseen](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/hear-the-unseen-fleemortals.md)  
- [Rockbreaker](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/rockbreaker-fleemortals.md)  
- [Tunnel-Adapted](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/tunnel-adapted-fleemortals.md)  

### Cave Lair Actions

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in a cave by giving them the following lair actions:

[Cave Lair Actions](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/legendary-group/cave-fleemortals.md)

### Fossil Cryptic

The cave-diving humans who first found fossil cryptics initially thought those beings were fossilized, reanimated skeletons of creatures predating recorded history. When the explorers' priest presented a holy symbol and attempted to turn the cryptics, he learned these fossilized bones aren't mindless undead—and seconds later, he wound up crushed to death by a pillar of stone.

***Primal Sentries.*** In truth, these living fossil amalgamations are inhabited by elemental spirits. Fossil cryptics are found in places of otherworldly beauty with a connection to an elemental plane of Quintessence—often in caves that have remained untouched for eons or whose tunnels are laced with veins of priceless metal in exquisite fractal patterns. The elemental spirits from that plane inhabit the fossils of creatures who once protected the site, carrying on their legacy. Archaeologists, miners, and others who disturb a cryptic's domain are ground into dust and subsumed into the cryptic's own form.

***Bones of the Earth.*** Though fossil cryptics vary wildly in their chosen shape and form, all contain a central cluster of fossils atop a churning column of rock and metal. With malleable limbs extending from their earthy core, cryptics move with unsettling quickness.

***Ancient Intelligence.*** Fossil cryptics often warn trespassers to leave their domains, speaking threats in Primordial before attacking. They weaponize columns of stone at range and can manipulate the ground around them, pushing and pulling friend and foe alike into the best positions for a battle.

### Koptourok

> [!note] Content Warning: Suffocation
> 
> The koptourok steals the breath of their victims. If you or any of your players find descriptions of suffocation upsetting, you may want to avoid using this creature or reflavor their abilities.
^content-warning-suffocation

Derived from an archaic duergar dialect, koptourok (cop-TOUR-ock (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Koptourok.html)) roughly translates to "dead tourist." These lost dead were raised in a world with a sky then spent their last moments in a dark, breathless place. They rise as rasping paper-skinned husks, like a cross between an unwrapped mummy and accordion bellows that forever expand and contract. They hunger only for what they've lost—breath.

***Abhorrent Vacuums.*** Those rare adventurers who have met a koptourok and lived to tell the tale can identify signs of one nearby. The air becomes noticeably thinner in the presence of this undead, and what little there is moves toward the koptourok.

***Ghoulish Symbiosis.*** Flesh-eating undead often hunt in tandem with a koptourok, since the breath-stealer can take what is theirs and leave the body for scavengers. It's especially common to see ghouls alongside a koptourok.

### Lamasombra

The lamasombra (lah-mah-SAHM-brah (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Lamasombra.html))—an eight-legged, gray-scaled reptile the size of an adult human—is almost certainly the work of a flesh-bending mage or cult. This lizard-arachnid hybrid specializes in hunting cavedwelling denizens.

***Apex Cave Predator.*** The lamasombra's unnatural scales bend darkness in a way that interferes with other creatures' darkvision. In dim light, this gives creatures without darkvision an unusual advantage against the lamasombra, as those with darkvision can't see the predator except in bright light. The lamasombra's specialized bones and foot pads eliminate sound and vibrations even at blinding speeds, rendering their prey's tremorsense useless. The creature's diseased mouth infects prey with boiling wastes disease, which keeps a victim feverish and bleeding long after an attack. After weakening their prey, the lamasombra follows the blood trail, stalking from the shadows and waiting for the diseased creature to die.

***Gleeful Hunter.*** If a lamasombra has any weakness, it's that they enjoy playing with prey a little too much. Once they pick a target, they are unrelenting in their pursuit, but patient in picking their moment to strike. They often needle prey for days before finally delivering sweet release from torment.

### Yumgrub

The yumgrub looks like an oozing apple-sized dumpling with a hundred tiny legs. Like a dumpling, the insect contains a delicious secret: their sweet flesh temporarily enhances the speed and strength of whoever consumes it. However, eating the yumgrub has a cost. They unleash a deeply upsetting scream when consumed, and after their magic wears off, it leaves the eater weary.

***Subterranean Delicacy.*** The yumgrub is the larval stage of the unremarkable tunnel moth. Subterranean and cave-dwelling humanoids first discovered their magic properties and began trading the larvae among communities of dwarves, elves, and goblins. Due to the yumgrub's remarkable benefits, underground conquerors sometimes use them to fuel soldiers in battle.

## Enchanted Forest

> [!quote] A quote from Mehmet Murat Ildan  
> 
> He who has no dreams, let him go to a beautiful forest to have many.

Magic permeates nature. From fulminating thunderstorms to nurturing berries, nature answers when adventurers seek its verdant potency. Where planar veils are thin, ancient spirits dwell, or ley lines emanate wild energy, enchanted forests await with mesmerizing creatures and mysteries.

### Enchanted Forest Traits

You can create an enchanted forest version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- [Speak with Beasts and Plants](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/speak-with-beasts-and-plants-fleemortals.md)  
- [Tree Stride](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/tree-stride-fleemortals.md)  
- [Living Forest](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/living-forest-fleemortals.md)  

### Enchanted Forest Lair Actions

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in an enchanted forest by giving them the following lair actions:

[Enchanted Forest Lair Actions](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/legendary-group/enchanted-forest-fleemortals.md)

### Bonestalker

Whispered legends tell of horrors who dwell in the deepest, darkest forests and torment villages on the outskirts. These so-called bonestalkers feed on the terror of their victims—and of entire villages—long before going in for the kill.

Bonestalkers are tall and unsettlingly thin. Their head is a monstrous skull with a jutting jaw, and their long arms are flightless black wings that end in clawed hands. Bonestalkers collect the skulls of their victims, carrying them inside their wings as they draw power from these trophies.

Fear Tactics. The bonestalker prefers to isolate their prey, using illusion spells to lure unwitting wanderers into the woods. These psychological tormenters enjoy a prolonged chase and a slow kill, drawing nourishment from their prey's fear. When a victim refuses to give in to terror, the enraged bonestalker attacks in a reckless fury.

> [!note] Revealing a Bonestalker
> 
> Bonestalkers are cryptids—their chilling legend, unsolved murders, and unconfirmed existence add to the terror they might inflict on adventurers. You can lead characters through an investigation of mysterious murders surrounding a forest village . . . then have the bonestalker pull out the victims' skulls during the fight, and let the characters connect the dots.
^revealing-a-bonestalker

### Dancing Lady

Strange visions in the mist are to be expected in enchanted forests, but in the case of the dancing lady, these figures aren't illusions—they're real . . . sort of.

The dancing lady is an enormous plant with white humanoid-sized flowers resembling figures in dresses. Large red-and-green leaves surround these hanging blooms. The dancing lady lurks around fey populations or other forest denizens, flowers peacefully turning until a threat appears. Once the plant's allies are endangered, the dancing lady's oversized flowers spring into dizzying dances to addle and frighten foes.

### Empyrean Stag

As Celestial wardens of the forest, empyrean stags appear only to defend forest denizens from great threats or to warn mortals about forthcoming calamities. Their white fur is dappled with blue, and their eyes shine with the darkness of night.

***Unyielding Defenders.*** Adventurers often clash with forest denizens, from hungry owlbears to mischievous fey. This violence draws an empyrean stag's ire, often provoking a deadly attack from the stag and their forest allies. Repentant adventurers can make restitution by helping the stag defend the wood from an even greater threat.

***Divine Knowledge.*** Those who impress an empyrean stag—typically by protecting the forest—are allowed to ask the stag one question, which the Celestial answers truthfully to the best of their ability. Between their antlers, they can show shimmering visions of the present or glimpses of the future. The horns glow gold when the stag aids an ally, and white when they divine information.

### Rotbeast

Enchanted forests aren't always flowers and vines—sometimes they're fungi, blight, and the creatures who carry them. One such creature, the rotbeast, turns faerie paradises into festering decay simply by passing through.

This faceless, fungi-covered creature has twisting stag horns and the body of a bull. As they wander the woods, they spoil vegetation in their path and create a network of fungi and decay.

***Territorial Herds.*** Rotbeasts live in herds and prefer to keep to one part of the forest, provided they have plenty of space. Other creatures who invade their territory are given no quarter. The rotbeasts weaken foes with their gouging horns, infect them with rotting hooves, then add new corpses to their decaying domain.

***Fungal Allies.*** Fungus-based plant creatures often peacefully coexist with rotbeasts, as they thrive in decaying lands. Some fungi even herd rotbeasts into new areas to make the forest more to their liking.

> [!note] Good-Aligned Enemies
> 
> It can be difficult to know when to deploy creatures who are typically good-aligned as enemies for the characters to fight. That's why there aren't many in this book. However, these creatures still have agendas that can bring them into conflict with the characters. For instance, the empyrean stag protects enchanted forests from violent invaders, and if the characters do battle with any creature native to the forest, it draws the stag's ire.

## Graveyard and Tomb

Adventurers who enter graveyards and ancient tombs often do so to keep the dead at rest, stop necromancy rituals, or consult the ghosts of wise sages and heroes of the past.

### Graveyard and Tomb Traits

You can create a graveyard or tomb version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- [Armor of Decay](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/armor-of-decay-fleemortals.md)  
- [Touch of Rot](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/touch-of-rot-fleemortals.md)  
- [Undying Hunger](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/undying-hunger-fleemortals.md)

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in a graveyard or tomb by giving them the following lair actions:

[Tomb Lair Actions](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/legendary-group/tomb-fleemortals.md)

### Ashen Hoarder

Grave robbing is dangerous business, but necromancers need bodies for their experiments. To procure supplies and stay out of danger, these mages build ashen hoarders—hulking constructs made of magically reinforced humanoid bones.

***Appendages and Spikes.*** The hoarder sports four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct's grim work. Articulated arms with attached tools and weapons aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies.

When the hoarder obtains a corpse, the construct impales it on one of the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with necrotic energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer's door.

***Bodies as Weapons.*** If enemies corner the hoarder, the construct can use the energy stored within their corpses to reanimate them as zombie allies or detonate the remains with explosive necrotic energy.

### Blood-Borne Ooze

Blood-borne oozes form when ambient necrotic energy seeps into the blood of a corpse. Hunger drives these creatures to slither from their rotting birthplace, seeking to feed on the bodily fluids of a living victim—from the inside.

Outside a host body, a blood-borne ooze resembles a gelatinous pool of blood mixed with other bodily ichor. The ooze's ability to permeate skin—living or dead—allows them to infect unsuspecting mourners, coroners, gravediggers, or other individuals who frequent cemeteries.

***Hidden Parasites.*** Whenever possible, a blood-borne ooze prefers to feed stealthily, inhabiting a host and draining their vitality over an extended period. Through careful feeding, an ooze can exist inside the same host for weeks before symptoms become apparent. Even then, the cause is commonly misdiagnosed until it's too late.

### Haunt

When a mass of souls meet a dark and bloody death, the unfortunate souls occasionally fuse into a furious collective called a haunt. Such tormented amalgamations of spirits are doomed to stalk the scene of their death until they're laid to rest.

These undead clouds of psychic energy are usually [invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible), but when viewed with the [see invisibility](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/see-invisibility-xphb.md) spell or similar magic, they appear as a churning silver-green fog of tangled limbs and screaming faces.

Souls drawn into a haunt lose all sense of individuality. Their pain, memories, and outrage meld into a confused mass that makes rational thought nearly impossible. Haunts can rarely tell friend from foe, and react violently to the presence of any being in their domain.

***Physically Bound.*** Unlike other ghosts, haunts are exclusively bound to the Mundane World, unable to leave the site where they formed. As such, a haunt can't retreat to the Ethereal Plane when endangered, but their rooted nature grants them greater control over physical objects in the environment than most incorporeal creatures achieve.

***Tortured Torturers.*** A haunt's dominant emotional state is abject rage, driving them to seek vengeance on all living beings. Haunts aren't content to merely slaughter their prey—they sadistically aim to trap and torment their victims.

### Lightthief

A lightthief is a fiend who comes to the Mundane World to feast on soul energy. They stalk graveyards and tombs, where they know vulnerable mourners come in the dark to pay their respects. These bat-winged creatures resemble flayed humanoid hands with a bloodshot eye leering from the palm—though their victims have little chance to notice them before darkness falls.

***Death in the Dark.*** Lightthieves often stalk victims in groups, using their supernatural powers to enter—and extinguish—light sources near their prey. The lightthieves consume each light's energy, then just before attacking, use this energy to power a hex that temporarily robs creatures of their darkvision.

The predator's strategy isn't without flaws. If another creature snuffs out a light source the fiend has entered, the lightthief is shunted out and momentarily helpless. Adventurers delving into burial sites would be wise to research such defenses.

***Desperate for Despair.*** While lightthieves prefer to target mourners, the graveyards and tombs they haunt are eventually forgotten. A lightthief in an ancient burial site is so ravenous for soul energy that they attack any living being they come across.

[Ashen Hoarder](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/construct/ashen-hoarder-fleemortals.md)

> [!note] Blood-Borne Surprise
> 
> A blood-borne ooze doesn't have to start consuming their host the moment the parasite enters the body. Instead, the ooze might enjoy the host's protection for a while, eating only when hungry. The characters could battle a foe only to have a blood-borne ooze or three suddenly emerge after damaging the enemy.

## Road

When people travel well-patrolled thoroughfares and live in sleepy hamlets, it's easy to believe that adventure is something that happens far away. But the wealth and assumed security of settled lands make them rich pickings for predators of all sorts—particularly those who can disguise their sinister natures or hide beneath the roads.

### Ankheg

Pebbles click as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon's peace, and an ankheg blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal: sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.

An ankheg is a chitinous, burrowing monstrosity larger than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.

***Pastoral Pest.*** Although ankhegs can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. Ankhegs hunt alone or in pairs, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make ankhegs virtually impossible to eradicate—unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain ankheg.

***Terror of the Thaw.*** Ankhegs are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, ankhegs hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace . . . but this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every ankheg awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.

### Bredbeddle

In their true forms, bredbeddles are headless giants who stand about fifteen feet tall. Forever searching for their missing heads, they are drawn to populous lands, where they decapitate passersby and magically adopt their victims' forms.

Although bredbeddles have no traditional sensory organs of their own, they are keenly aware of their surroundings. Some lurk along dark country lanes in their monstrous true forms. Others walk disguised among crowds, dropping their facades only long enough to waylay a stranger and lop off their head.

***Immortal Wanderers.*** Bredbeddles don't age, and even when slain, their bodies reform a few days later. Long ago, bredbeddles were giants who stood high among the nobility of giantkind. But when they declared themselves rulers of all giantkind, their kin thwarted the coup and beheaded the bredbeddles. Now these fallen nobles search the world for their missing heads, each wielding the axe that decapitated them. Many claim their heads are kept for safekeeping in some fire giant's cellar, believing they'll be returned after an indeterminate period of good behavior (which the bredbeddles have thus far not exhibited).

### Weeping Willow

When a dryad bonds with a tree, the connection grants the tree immortality and a measure of fey magic. The encroachments of civilization, however, threaten this sylvan idyll. Many dryads fall to a woodcutter's axe, while others become infatuated with a mortal and choose to leave their tree—and immortality—behind. A tree that mourns for their lost dryad becomes a weeping willow.

***Lake of Tears.*** A weeping willow bears drooping branches that sprinkle the ground with the tree's tears. If they stand in one spot long enough, a pond of saltwater eventually forms—and sometimes, those waters reflect the image of a dead dryad. Creatures who seek shelter in a weeping willow's bower find themselves overcome with a lethargic melancholy, and many wanderers starve to death rather than stir from this rest.

***Verdant Vengeance.*** Although not fundamentally evil, weeping willows resent mortals for taking their dryads away. The trees haunt the borders of settlements, luring their prey with song and sweet words or catching them in gnarled roots. Willows whisper words of vengeance to likeminded creatures, mustering allies against nearby humanoid settlers. They also rain enchanting tears to transform their greatest enemies into enthralled allies—or if that fails, into twisted trees.

## Ruined Keep

Whether a crumbling wizard's tower or the lonely outpost of a long-since-forgotten kingdom, the ruined keep can be found in any environment. These crumbling structures might be decrepit, but they are rarely abandoned.

### Ruined Keep Traits

You can create a ruined keep version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- [Ruin Climber](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/ruin-climber-fleemortals.md)  
- [Ruin Delver](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/ruin-delver-fleemortals.md)  
- [Ruin Runner](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/ruin-runner-fleemortals.md)  

### Ruined Keep Lair Actions

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in a ruined keep by giving them the following lair actions:

[Ruined Keep Lair Actions](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/legendary-group/ruined-keep-fleemortals.md)

> [!note] Express Descent Goes Deep

A fallen creature takes 3 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage from the fall and lands [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone), and they can climb out of the pit without making an ability check.

### Former Purpose

A ruined keep once had a purpose. Was it built to protect the region from invaders, house a ruler's vast wealth, or serve as an arcane laboratory? The keep's former purpose can inspire you with ideas about the creatures and objects that currently reside there. You can choose or roll for the purpose of a ruin on the Keep Former Purposes table.

### Flintmoth Swarm

When exploring a seemingly abandoned tower, if an adventurer hears an endless soft clatter like thousands of loose pebbles falling downhill, the ruin may be home to a flintmoth swarm. These elemental insects eat stone ruins over the course of centuries. Their wings are sharp and hard as flint, and their life cycles are measured in decades. Happy to remain near-motionless for months on end as they sustain themselves on stonework one minuscule mouthful at a time, flintmoths rarely move unless disturbed. When they do take flight, they must devour stone far more quickly to maintain their energy.

***Razor-Sharp Swarmers.*** The moth's stony wings offer both defense and offense. A single flintmoth is little threat to a humanoid, but hundreds or thousands fluttering past turn victims into mincemeat one tiny slice at a time.

***Nature's Newest.*** Flintmoths can eat natural rock, but they greatly prefer constructed stonework. If left unchecked for many years, a flintmoth infestation can destroy entire structures. The adaptable creatures often consume from the bottom up, slowly deteriorating stone sewers, dungeons, or cellars until the whole structure is at risk of collapse. Most active settlements control moth populations with a watchful eye, so massive swarms are usually found only in abandoned ruins.

### Lacuna

The lacuna (lah-COON-ah (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Lacuna.html)) feeds on the grief of abandoned places. First, this evil fiend feasts on emotions of lonely residents or mourners who come to pay their respects. The deaths of these victims begins a grief cycle that supplies the lacuna indefinitely with even more prey.

***Statue Stalkers.*** A lacuna takes the form of a cracked and crumbling statue, their face a mask frozen in an expression of unbearable sorrow. Whenever adventurers arrive in a lacuna's feeding ground, the fiend follows them for a time, reveling in any violence the visitors commit against other hostile creatures. But should the delvers find joy, perhaps while uncovering treasure or after surviving a difficult battle, the lacuna strikes, intent on inflicting and devouring misery.

***Half in Our World.*** Lacunas exist half in the Mundane World and half in whatever lower plane they originated from. This dual existence allows the lacuna to teleport at will and avoid harm.

### Thornblood

A thornblood grows from curse-empowered seeds embedded in a corpse. This enormous mass of living, thorny vines is a manifestation of nature's hate, and an antibody to the intrusion of civilization.

***Nature's Outrage.*** When a stone structure and its people intrude on nature's domain, a dying druid, dryad, or witch can utter a taboo curse, planting seeds in their own flesh. In death, a curse-bearer transforms themself into a thornblood rather than allow civilization a foothold in field or forest.

***Overgrown, Overwhelmed.*** As the corpse blooms into supernatural plant life, the thornblood quickly engulfs the area, untamable by flame or blade. The plants envelop everything in their path until the site where they grow is cleared of life. They then leave any encroaching corpses to rot where they lay. The curse-bearer remains beside those victims, their bones entwined with vines that are ready to rise again should intruders ever dare to return.

## Sewer

Deep beneath the city streets, winding tunnels holding murky waters have been built above decaying secrets. In this dripping darkness, strange creatures grow fatter—and deadlier—on the toxic byproducts of civilization.

[Sewer Lair Actions](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/legendary-group/sewer-fleemortals.md)

### Arcane Amalgam

An arcane amalgam forms when the polluted discards of magical experiments coalesce in sewers. These bits of unpredictable oils and tainted arcane energies form an oozing swarm of thumb-sized globules.

***Dormant Predators.*** Arcane amalgams gather in psychedelic clumps that lie still when no magic is about, though they spring to violence if disturbed by curious rodents or sewer workers. These translucent globs are easily overlooked while moving in small pools or resting in standing water.

***Magic-Fed.*** As arcane runoff passes near an amalgam, the swarm draws this in, expanding even further. On the rare occasion an amalgam encounters a spell or magic item, each drop springs to life with an eager mouth, seeking to consume anything—or anyone—magical within reach. Once the arcane amalgam has the scent of this magic, they mercilessly hunt their quarry.

***Trash to Treasure.*** The amalgam slowly digests their magic diet, becoming dormant again after eating their fill. Adventurers lucky enough to survive an encounter with one of these swarms might find valuable spell components or magic items among the remains.

### Stoneback Isopod

Stoneback isopods usually scavenge forest floors, but in the depths of urban sewers, they grow far more formidable than their rural counterparts. These mastiff-sized bugs seek out dark, humid places to feed on decaying plants, decomposing matter, or anything slow enough to catch. They lurk in running water, blending with stones in the channel—then when a delicious meal passes by, the isopod clamps down with powerful mandibles.

***Protective Carapace.*** When threatened, the stoneback isopod protects themself by curling the folds of their rocky carapace together into a sturdy defensive ball, granting them significant protection against attackers.

***Large Broods.*** Stoneback isopods lay huge tracts of eggs that hatch fully grown broods. They're rarely solitary, preferring to share plentiful feeding areas, then migrate as groups when food becomes scarce.

***Any Sewer Will Do.*** Stoneback isopods can survive in both bitter cold and scorching heat. Their diet of decaying matter makes them particularly adapted to sewers and urban living, where they can scavenge freely while sheltering in murky pools and drainage.

### Valochera

The valochera (val-OH-cherr-ah (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Valochera.html)) grows in the grime and muck of a city's waste. Once grown, this enormous yellow mushroom can plod through the sewers on their root-like mycelia. They constantly spew a dangerous cloud of spores from a gelatinous cap, which opens to reveal a hungry maw that devours liquefied prey.

***Hungry for Nutrients.*** While valocheras can squeeze nutrients out of any piece of organic matter, they prefer flesh—packed with nutritional goodness, it keeps them fed for days. In sewers, they most often feed on rats and bugs.

***Searing Stem and Smell.*** Before going in for the kill, the valochera releases foul-smelling spores that sicken prey. To finish the job, each valochera has mycelia that secrete acid to liquefy larger prey before consumption.

> [!note] Gross Smells
> 
> Sewers smell like poop. It's kind of their whole deal. You can use the following optional rule to help evoke the sewer's grossness and make it a more challenging environment for the player characters. At the end of each hour a character who needs to breathe spends in the sewer, they must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour or until they leave the sewer and remain outside of it for 10 minutes.

> 
> This book introduces a new Fungus tag, which you can see in the metadata line of some Plant stat blocks. At your discretion, you can add this tag to other creatures in the core rules, such as the violet fungus. This tag applies to some traits in this book, like the rotbeast's Forest Rot and Rotwake traits.
> 
> We also implemented this tag for clarity. While science makes a distinction between fungi and plants, the game's core rules puts all fungus-based and plant-based creatures into the same Plant creature type. It makes sense that the official designers of the game wouldn't want to get too noodly with their creature types, but it turns out that many folks who are MCDM fans are also fungus fans! We had multiple people write to us and ask why we were calling fungi plants, so we decided a new tag would help clear things up.

## Swamp

> [!quote]  
> 
> Whatever horrors you think you've seen in the world, they pale beside the nightmares birthed in the swamp.

Whether exploring forgotten ruins, seeking a rare herbal remedy, or facing a powerful black dragon, adventurers should beware the unknown when entering the damp, dense wilds of a swamp. These isolated biomes are neither patient nor forgiving to strangers.

### Swamp Traits

You can create a swamp version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- [Acidic Nature](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/acidic-nature-fleemortals.md)  
- [Swamp Stride](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/swamp-stride-fleemortals.md)  
- [One with the Swamp](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/one-with-the-swamp-fleemortals.md)  

> [!note] Swampy Terrain
> 
> You can use this optional rule for combat encounters in swampy terrain. Swampy terrain is difficult terrain. If a creature without a swimming speed ends their turn without moving, they are [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained). A creature can use an action to make a DC 14 Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check, freeing themself or another creature they can reach from the swampy terrain on a success.

You can create a more formidable version of an existing creature who lives in a swamp by giving them the following lair actions:

[Swamp Lair Actions](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/legendary-group/swamp-fleemortals.md)

### Bog Body

Bog bodies are humanoid corpses that the swamp naturally mummified over several months. The process makes their skin tough and leathery, protecting them from harm and helping them to remain unseen in a dark, treacherous swamp. In many cases, the corpse's preservation means that at first glance, a bog body could easily be mistaken for a living person, with hair, skin, and even clothing still intact.

***An Endless Watch.*** Each time a swamp is threatened, a new set of bog bodies rises, adding to those awakened in the past. The older a swamp is, the more bog bodies it has. Some of the most ancient swamps have so many awakened bog bodies that passage is impossible for all but the most powerful visitors.

***Silent Stalker.*** Bog bodies use stealth to attack unwary intruders. They are adept at hiding in plain sight, blending in with plant life or submerging themselves fully in the murky water, then bursting out and taking their target by surprise.

### Marsh Hydra

Swamp hags, bog witches, and other mages of the wet places often eschew the stereotypical cat or bird familiar for something more evocative of their environment: snakes. For some, though, a snake—even a magically enhanced one—is too ordinary. These mages seek out ancient grafting spells and use them to create marsh hydras. This enormous monstrosity isn't a true hydra, but forms when a swarm of snakes is magically conglomerated into a single creature with multiple serpent heads.

***Cooperation is Key.*** Freshly created marsh hydras are nearly impossible to command, as the individual snake minds inside their body vie for dominance. Many never make it out of this stage, succumbing to infighting and ultimately proving too chaotic and violent to be useful servants. Such feral marsh hydras account for the majority of those encountered by adventurers. However, those marsh hydras who do learn to work together as a single organism can serve their creators capably.

***Concealed Heads.*** Though they sport multiple heads like a common hydra, the marsh hydra functions differently. Instead of regrowing heads as they are destroyed, a marsh hydra's body contains more heads beyond those initially seen on the outside. Though a marsh hydra rarely displays more than five or six heads at a time, some store as many as two dozen additional heads inside their body, depending on the ambition of their original creator. These internal heads can be rotated out and vice versa, allowing the creature to withstand even the most grievous wounds for a time.

### Rot Angel

Standing five to six feet tall, floating black-and-brown mushrooms move about the swamp like jellyfish, their thirteen prehensile eyestalks dangling beneath their cap. These rot angels are in fact celestials, typically serving gods of death in their search for the recently deceased. The touch of their stalk-like proboscises causes rapid decay in organic matter.

***Death's Cleanup Crew.*** Death gods send rot angels to remove all traces of a corpse from the world after that person's soul has been taken. A corpse decomposed by the touch of a rot angel can't be returned to life, made Undead, or otherwise supernaturally affected. The gods rarely explain why a given corpse requires a rot angel, and these angels don't ask.

***Dedicated Servants.*** Once a rot angel has been dispatched to a corpse, nothing short of death can dissuade them from completing their assignment. Should a rot angel be interrupted in their work, they have free rein to deal with the interruption in whatever way is required, up to and including the destruction of the disrupting forces.

### Swamp Dryad

Swamp dryads mirror the trees to which they are bound. Some stand uncannily tall, with twisting, elongated torsos easily mistaken for tree trunks. Others expand laterally, sporting up to six long arms dripping with moss.

***Bound by Choice.*** Unlike their more common cousins, swamp dryads begin life as mortals, usually as herbalists and other swamp dwellers who spent their lives becoming one with their home. Those who are clever, powerful, or lucky enough may meet an existing swamp dryad who teaches them the secret of binding. Though this process is arduous and can be fatal, a successful binding transforms the mortal into a fey and links them to their chosen tree. Once bound, the new fey and their tree share the same restrictions as a typical dryad.

***Reclusive and Territorial.*** After the binding, a swamp dryad's new connection to swamp flora and fauna leaves them with little desire to interact with people. As they would face great danger should their tree be harmed, swamp dryads are extremely distrustful of visitors.

***Valuable Allies.*** If the trust of a swamp dryad is earned, they can provide knowledge of the swamp and its paths, access to healing and other magic, and advice about avoiding or interacting with other swamp denizens. A swamp dryad ally can be the difference between life and death in this unfamiliar terrain.

> [!note] Big Ball of Snakes
> 
> Before there was the marsh hydra, there was the big ball of snakes. When we first started working on the swamp environment, we created a creature that was just an enormous swarm of different snakes all entangled together in one ball, rolling through the swamp looking for a meal. This stat block was simply called the big ball of snakes.
> 
> We had a lot of laughs about that idea but ultimately decided the big ball of snakes was just too silly for this particular book. The design team still really liked the stat block's mechanics, so we changed the lore and adjusted some language and, voilà, the marsh hydra was born.

## Underground

The vast cavernous depths of the World Below are places of danger and wonder, filled with odd denizens who have adapted to life in the dark. From skittering predators to deadly fungi, threats lurk in the shadows, ready to ambush unwary adventurers.

### Underground Traits

You can create an underground version of an existing creature by adding one or more of the following traits to their stat block:

- [Fungal Infestation](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/fungal-infestation-fleemortals.md)  
- [Shadow Blend](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/optional-features/shadow-blend-fleemortals.md)

> [!note]
> Converter's Note: I thought about adding in the missing sentence here, but why bother? It's a copypasta from all of the other environmental lair action sections.

### Deep Dreamer

A fine network of barbed black filaments supports the deep dreamer's fungal body, making them resemble a massive sinister dandelion. These plants drift through the air on gentle psionic currents, propelled by the spores they constantly release. As other creatures dream, the deep dreamer uses their filaments to feed on those creatures' psychic energy. A deep dreamer's influence can compel creatures to become lost in their dreams, never to wake up.

***Drifting Dreams.*** Deep dreamers seem perpetually lost in their own reverie, and collisions with solid objects often go unnoticed. When they do become aware of other creatures, they use their spores to share their strange dreams in hopes of stoking a creature's imagination and creating pleasant dreams to feed on.

***Sinister Bonds.*** Some deep dreamers unwittingly accumulate colonies of creatures who are permanently lost in dreams. These creatures follow their deep dreamers wherever they drift, lumbering after the fungus in a trance—and even jumping in front of the deep dreamer to save them from danger. Some of these creatures have been with their dreamers for so long that they're permanently tethered to one of the dreamer's filaments.

### Gem Jelly

Commonly found in caves where natural crystals grow, gem jellies secrete a digestive acid that breaks down rock and allows them to feed on the resulting minerals. Their diet gives them an iridescent sheen, and their bodies often reflect the colors of the crystals they feed on.

Though these oozes don't feed on other creatures, gem jellies are exceedingly territorial and attack intruders in their domains without hesitation.

***Crystal Mimicry.*** A gem jelly in its resting state resembles a natural formation of crystal—and often appears valuable to explorers. When approached by such interlopers, the jelly's true nature quickly becomes clear as they lash out with long crystal-barbed pseudopods.

***Psionic Organisms.*** Gem jellies are attuned to psychic energies and can send out pulses that resonate with the minds of other creatures. These pulses can be used to communicate simple concepts such as "food" or "danger." Some people believe gem jellies are actually sapient, and a few even set out to look for them in search of otherworldly wisdom. . . but most of these misguided pilgrims never return from their quest.

> 
> Manifold 11, the World Below, into catacombs or tombs in search of remains to feast on. the Dark Under All, is a world of caves and wine-dark seas. There is no sky there—no sun.

### Leyleech

Leyleeches dwell in caverns near underground ley lines. These slug-like creatures feed on magic; when they sense its presence, they reach with their toothy maws to siphon off the energy and engorge themselves with its power. When a leyleech is full, the spines on their body arc with magical energy.

***Frenzied Taste.*** When leyleeches feed on natural ley line energy, they remain docile and complacent. However, the spells cast by living creatures drive leyleeches into a frenzy, prompting hungry attacks with little regard for the leyleech's own safety.

***Dormant Threats.*** While they aren't feeding, leyleeches curl up into rock-like cocoons that can be mistaken for boulders, and unwary travelers may find themselves sharing a resting place near a colony. These dormant leyleeches emerge hungry when they sense the presence of magic.

***Ley Line Siphons.*** When large colonies of leyleeches gather in a single area, their feeding can destabilize or even drain a ley line completely, affecting the way magic behaves in the immediate area. When several nearby colonies feed at once, it can affect a region miles wide.

### Marvorok

Marvoroks (marr-VORR-ock (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Marvorok.html)) are insidious predators who dwell in the deepest layers of the World Below, constantly searching for prey to sate their seemingly endless hunger. These monstrous bipedal beings sport six arms, four of which end in sharp, sword-like talons. Their eyesight is poor, but they make up for it with their incredible sense of smell that allows them to track by scent alone. Marvoroks use their claws to dig into rocky surfaces and pull themselves up, climbing as easily as they run.

***Silent Death.*** Remarkably stealthy for their massive size, marvoroks lie in wait for their prey before moving in for the kill. They wait patiently for the perfect ambush, leaping out from hiding and clawing their victims to pieces in a vulnerable moment.

***Solitary Hunters.*** Marvoroks prefer to lead solitary lives, coming together only to mate or to hunt particularly large or dangerous prey. When times are lean, they work together to drive creatures toward a common hunting ground where they can corner their prey. . . though this usually ends in fighting among themselves to determine who eats.

***Eaters of the Dead.*** Marvoroks aren't above scavenging for food, stripping rotten flesh from the bones of longdead creatures. Starving marvoroks even claw their way into catacombs or tombs in search of remains to feast on.
