# Chapter 3: Villain Parties
*Source: Flee, Mortals!, p. 346* 

This chapter presents seven villain parties in order of the threat they present in combat (see ""Optimized Party Level""). As you introduce these villains to your game, keep the following guidance in mind.

## Portraying Villainy

All the parties in this section are explicitly villains. These characters aren't neutral mercenaries who can be negotiated with and possibly recruited. They're remorseless people who want to do bad—sometimes deeply awful—things. And in many cases, they do these things with glee. These are horrible people.

We believe that the more explicitly evil your villains are, the more motivated many players are to fight them—and the more triumphant players feel when their heroes win. But this is just a matter of taste, and many GMs and players aren't interested in that kind of fantasy. They might prefer a more relatable or comedic villain, or they might prefer adventures where the heroes are pitted against nature (although this book will be of little use in that event). We like those things too!

The creatures in this book all conform to a certain tone of realism and plausibility filtered through the lens of drama. But it's difficult for even this mighty tome to compete with real-world villainy in terms of sheer horrific evil—and some players don't want their games to compete like that. It's essential to know your table, talk to your players, and get a sense of what kinds of drama they enjoy and engage with. If you read these entries and find a villain's motives or methods too awful for your table, you have the option to reskin them, keeping their statistics and changing their fiction. We recommend using safety tools, like the ones found in the free MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit, to facilitate clear and concise communication with your players about anything that makes them or you uncomfortable.

This book took care of designing, testing, and balancing the powers and features of these villains. The way you use them now is up to you. If you like the implementation of the Black Iron Pact but find their bigotry gross, you could make them the leaders of a cult, a secret society trying to overthrow a beloved leader, or whatever makes sense for your world!

At the end of the day, this book is yours. These villains are yours. Use them however you see fit.

> [!note] Individual Villains
> 
> While the villain parties presented in this chapter are meant to fight the characters together, you can always have the heroes take on villains individually before the final showdown. Those individual fights should still be memorable, so give your villain a few henchmen, a cool consumable magic item, and a decent means of escape (or resurrection).

## Optimized Party Level

Each villain party is optimized to battle five characters of a specific level, as noted on the Villain Parties by Optimized Level table. These challenges were calculated assuming all members of the villain party are encountered in combat together. They're designed to give characters of the optimized level a fun challenge, especially if the heroes have already expended some resources on another encounter or two.

Each party's villains are meant to be fought together as a group. They are a difficult encounter for a party of the optimized level, so don't throw too many prelude encounters at your characters. They'll need all the spell slots, powerful features, and other resources they can get to survive!

**Villain Parties by Optimized Level**

| Optimized Level | Party |  |
|-----------------|-------|--|
| 3rd | Grave Order |
| 5th | Abominations |
| 7th | Black Iron Pact |
| 9th | Wilderkith |
| 11th | Amethyst Knife |
| 13th | Soulbinders |
| 15th | Hallowed Dark |

## Villain Party Actions

Villain party actions work much like an action-oriented creature's villain actions (see ""Action-Oriented Creatures"" in the introduction), with the following changes:

- Instead of one creature having three villain actions, a party shares a pool of five villain party actions.  
- Each villain party action is performed by a specific creature in the villain party, and each can be used once during an encounter after an enemy's turn.  
- The party can take these actions in any order, but only one villain can use theirs each round.  
- A villain action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).  

Each party's section presents their villain actions in a recommended order for dramatic effect, often saving the most devastating for last. Odds are that you won't use every villain party action in a single encounter, as some creatures will be defeated before they get to use their action. That's okay! If every villain action were used in an encounter, it would be deadly indeed.

## Slow Burn

To create the most dramatic showdown with a villain party, you should build tension between the characters and their adversaries before it all goes down. Make the players eager for a chance to take down these wicked foes.

To start, have the characters learn about the evils of the villains firsthand before ever coming face to face with a member of the group. For instance, you could have the characters stumble upon the aftermath of the Wilderkith's destruction of a peaceful community before ever meeting the terrorists.

Then you should have the characters interact with lackeys of the villain party. They might even cross swords with one or two of the individual members of the party or see them from afar. Give the characters ample opportunity to ruin one or more of the party's plots and learn about each individual villain. The more information they gain and plans they foil, the better!

Eventually, after enough foiled plans at the hands of the characters, the villain party should strike back. This could be the moment of the final showdown if you're running a shorter game, or you could have the villain party hit the characters where it hurts. Just like the characters might be researching the villains, the evildoers look into the heroes. The villain party might raze a location important to the characters, harm or kidnap one of their NPC allies, or destroy or steal an object of great personal importance. The villains should make it clear they were the ones who did this and leave an obvious message for the characters that says something like, "Back off if you don't want more bad things to happen to everything you love."

After all this, if the characters haven't decided to take on the villains directly, then the evildoers bring the fight to them. They lay a trap and spring it the first chance they get, laying it all on the line to get rid of the characters who have caused them so much anguish.

## Grave Order

*Optimized for Five 3rd-Level Characters*

> [!note] Content Warning: Enslaved Spirit, Body Horror, and Religious Desecration
> 
> The spirit of an adventurer named Elyas Leodeir is imprisoned within the body of the Horror, an undead warrior animated by the Grave Order. If you don't want the imprisonment and enslavement of a spirit to play a role in your campaign, you can make the Horror a mindless undead creature instead. In addition, the Horror is a conglomeration of corpses; if anyone in your game is uncomfortable with that level of body horror, you can instead make the Horror an enormous zombie.
> 
> Jedar Pike's backstory includes desecrating the bones of a saint. If religious desecration is a troubling plot point for your group, Jedar's profane ritual didn't require those components.
^content-warning-enslaved-spirit-body-horror-and-religious-desecration

Rightfully reviled for their desecrations, the Grave Order's necromancers and gruesome creations seek power over the living by defiling the natural order of death. If left to perfect their insidious rituals and gather corpses, they will certainly descend on the Mundane World in a scourge of undeath.

### Background

The Grave Order serves no ambitions save their own. Each member was shunned for their unique blasphemies, but they otherwise escaped their crimes' consequences. Lestheris Soldrei gathered the group together so they could seize the world in an unliving grip.

Though the Grave Order's allies are few, they animate those they lack—whether that be powerful necrotic constructs or a horde of undead minions.

### Goals

Though each necromancer in the Grave Order has a unique dark dream, together they are committed to conquest through undeath. Condemned for their forbidden pursuits, the order also harbors festering grudges against those who vilified them. All who obstruct the Grave Order's aspirations will suffer a thousandfold in the glorious dead world to come.

Though these necromancers seek to animate an army, they're unsatisfied with the husks of mere commoners. The Grave Order unearths the graves of great heroes and reanimates their bones, flesh, or spirits. With the power of legends at their command, the Grave Order will topple kingdoms and strike fear into the hearts of their sworn enemies.

### Methods

The Grave Order roams the world, learning folklore to track down the graves of renowned heroes. They camp near graveyards and burial grounds. Under the cover of night, they are remorseless graverobbers, picking burial plots clean. They have no respect for local traditions or beliefs, using corpses as fodder to reach their true prize.

If discovered, the Grave Order shows no mercy to opposition. Meddlers just provide additional corpses—and all the better if those come from adventurers with dreams of glory and bleeding hearts.

### Halorin Yandres

[Halorin Yandres](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/halorin-yandres-fleemortals.md) trained for battle from his youth. After proving his dedication to the art of war, the human was assigned as a bodyguard to the brilliant young mage Lestheris Soldrei. When she showed Halorin kindness and trust, he repaid it in kind, sharing his darkest secrets with her.

Halorin supported his charge's macabre passions from the start—in part due to his devotion to her, but also driven by the euphoria he feels when a life slips away under his hand. The warrior enjoys killing in Lestheris's name, knowing his corpses help build the Grave Order.

When an adventuring group known as the Golden Valor sought to bring the order to justice, Halorin valiantly protected Lestheris and slew their foes before tragically succumbing to his wounds. The necromancer reanimated her bodyguard, preserving his mind in the process. Undeath hasn't tempered his bloodlust or his loyalty. For his dedication, Halorin leads the order's lesser undead in battle.

### Jedar Pike

A human apostate cleric, [Jedar Pike](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/jedar-pike-fleemortals.md) serves a being called Vodor who claims to be a trapped and forgotten god of death. Vodor promised Jedar unimaginable power in exchange for freedom. To free his lord, Jedar defiled the bones of entombed saints for a profane ritual, only to be caught before he could complete the spell. His imminent execution was interrupted by Lestheris and Halorin, who cut their way through the guards and executioner to recruit Jedar into the Grave Order.

Jedar's cold and callous demeanor belies a fervent faith to Vodor. He excels in magics that manipulate bones, and he uses corporeal undead to defend and bolster his allies.

> [!quote] A quote from Lestheris Soldrei  
> 
> The dead are so much easier to control than the living. Death will make you see things my way. Do not fight its embrace.

### Lestheris Soldrei

Treasured as a wizard prodigy in her youth, [Lestheris Soldrei](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/lestheris-soldrei-fleemortals.md) flourished under the protection and opportunities afforded her. As the half-elf grew into an insatiable arcane scholar, mentors assumed her academic interest in necromancy was mere morbid curiosity, but her fascination soon became experimentation with the forbidden. Lestheris dreamed of cheating death and ruling forever—a privilege she believed the universe owed her brilliance—and her devoted bodyguard Halorin only encouraged her ambitions.

Lestheris's teachers finally saw the evil in her and forbade any further dalliances with necromancy. But the young mage had already tasted power, and she killed her ignorant teachers and took their spellbooks.

Determined to become a lich and rule the Mundane World forever, Lestheris founded the Grave Order, gathering other necromancers to work toward her grand vision. While she is skilled in all aspects of necromancy, Lestheris specializes in the incorporeal: subjugating spirits, binding souls, and empowering her magic with such essences.

### Mycete

A peculiar tiefling with a distracted air, [Mycete](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/mycete-fleemortals.md)'s body is crisscrossed with yellow veins of a beautiful parasitic fungus. She has developed a symbiotic relationship with her fungus, which she adores and has named Amber Decay. Mycete dreams of cultivating a garden to cover the entire world—a dream that quickly put her at odds with the people of her home village, for this fungus grows best in the dying bodies of humanoids ... and if those bodies are later reanimated, it continues to thrive in their undead husks.

After Mycete was caught slaughtering neighbors to serve as zombified hosts for her blossoms, the villagers captured the necromancer, planning to burn her and her creations. The Grave Order intervened by killing the villagers, saving Mycete, and bringing her into their fold. She specializes in cultivating Amber Decay in the cavities of undead and spreading it across the field of battle, hindering and enervating her foes.

### The Horror

[The Horror](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/undead/the-horror-fleemortals.md) is a distended construct of stitched skin and grafted limbs bearing weapons made from sharpened bone. The Grave Order stitched this creation together from the corpses of the Golden Valor, an adventuring party who dared to challenge the necromancers. They then bound the soul of Elyas Leodeir—a cunning rogue who killed Halorin and earned Lestheris's personal ire—to the grotesque form.

Ensorcelled by Lestheris's magic, Elyas is forced to fight against his will from within the prison made of his former friends. This implacable avatar of death and destruction is the greatest of the Grave Order's undead creations, and the first harbinger of the necromancers' future army.

### Magic

Halorin wears the [pendant of grave regeneration](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/pendant-of-grave-regeneration-fleemortals.md), a gift from Lestheris after his reanimation. Lestheris carries the [Tome of the Ethereal](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/tome-of-the-ethereal-fleemortals.md).

### Grave Order Villain Actions

The Grave Order has five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

- **Action 1 Bulwark of Bone.** Jedar animates four [decrepit skeleton](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/undead/decrepit-skeleton-fleemortals.md)s, who appear in unoccupied spaces he can see within 30 feet of him. The skeletons act immediately after Jedar on the same initiative count and follow his verbal orders. If Jedar dies, the skeletons are destroyed.  
- **Action 2 Forward Assault.** Halorin commands each allied Undead minion within 30 feet of him who can hear him. Each target can move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.  
- **Action 3 Threshing Flail.** The Horror moves up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. When the Horror ends that movement, they whirl their bone hook around them, and each enemy within 30 feet of them must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (`2d6`) piercing damage and is knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).  
- **Action 4 Fungal Paradise.** Mycete chooses one or more [rotting zombie](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/undead/rotting-zombie-fleemortals.md)s under her control who she can see within 30 feet of her. Each chosen zombie is destroyed and explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area of one or more explosions must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (`2d4`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The ground in each explosion's area then becomes covered with fungal growth, as if affected by Mycete's Fungal Growth action. If Mycete controls no rotting zombies within 30 feet, she instead uses her Animate Husks, even if it's unavailable, without expending a use of it.  
- **Action 5 The Tide of Death.** Lestheris animates a number of [shade](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/undead/shade-fleemortals.md)s equal to the number of enemies she can see within 30 feet of her. Each shade appears within 30 feet of her in an unoccupied space she can see. The shades act immediately after Lestheris on the same initiative count and follow her verbal orders. If Lestheris dies, the shades are destroyed.

> I gave my life for Lestheris. She gave it back to me–plus a little something more. Your corpse will be mine to command.

> [!note] Golden Valor
> 
> The Golden Valor fell when they dared to face the Grave Order. Now their corpses make up the Horror. This group of adventurers was known for hunting bandits and small demon cults when they decided to take on the Grave Order. Their members included the following heroes:
> 
> - Elyas Leodeir, a half-elf rogue  
> - Gar Tailhooks, a dwarf barbarian  
> - Olliandra Fenwick, a human ranger  
> - Scrubias Nackvar, a gnome wizard  
> - Willis Tormack, a human paladin

## Abominations

*Optimized for Five 5th-Level Characters*

> [!note] Content Warning: Body Horror, Torture, Cannibalism, and Eugenics
> 
> The Abominations enjoy butchering, torturing, and devouring humanoids, and each Abomination's body has been stitched together from various humanoid and animal parts. If this would make the game unfun for your group, you can make the Abominations appear more natural (or magical) rather than grotesque. You can similarly skip the descriptions of them butchering bodies, eating people, and other violent and gory details.
> 
> The Abominations' origin story involves countless rounds of experimentation on sapient creatures followed by the murder of any creations deemed "imperfect." If this is hurtful for anyone in your game, you could decide that N'shalla and Evae's earlier creations were unable to live for more than a short time (if at all), or simply skip the experimental batches entirely.
^content-warning-body-horror-torture-cannibalism-and-eugenics

You think you've lost them. It's dark and raining, and they were still cramming chunks of elf flesh in their mouths when you fled. But as you catch your breath, your mind explodes in pain, driving you to your knees. The animal-headed predators huddle around you, licking chops and cackling with hungry glee. The Abominations have eaten everyone else. Now they're going to eat you.

### Background

Perhaps some evil deity brought the Abominations' creators together. Maybe it was just a cruel trick of fate. After their respective orders exiled them for magical experimentation on unwilling subjects, the druid N'shalla and the mage Evae Yawn crossed paths—and instantly fell in love. With their passions and forbidden knowledge combined, the twisted pair took up their dark work.

Determined to create bloodthirsty monsters who would exact revenge on the lovers' old organizations, N'shalla and Evae produced batch after batch of monstrosities, destroying any they considered less than perfect. Evae began each reation by growing a lifeless humanoid husk from raw materials, and N'shalla replaced its head and limbs with wild animal parts. Then together, they gave the monsters life ... and when the creatures inevitably proved flawed, the evil lovers ended them and started over yet again. After ten years of failure, Evae and N'shalla finally believed themselves victorious—they had created a band of five creatures who seemed the ultimate combination of strength, beauty, ferocity, and cold intelligence. But the monstrosities weren't obedient. They were hungry.

N'shalla's final words before being torn apart were, "You are not our children. You are abominations!" After devouring both creators, their children remained hungry. They went hunting.

### Goals

The Abominations have one goal—consume the flesh, organs, and bones of powerful humanoids. They zealously believe this makes them stronger, both physically and spiritually. The obsessed predators have no other hobbies or interests. There is only the next hunt.

### Methods

The monstrosities set up camp outside of humanoid settlements, observing the population for days before selecting the most worthy meal. Adventurers make the finest meat, for they hold great power—and few common folk investigate the deaths of heroes with a dangerous lifestyle. The Abominations have a particular taste for those who practice arcane or nature magic, as it reminds them of their first meal. Such prey is slowly and ritualistically sacrificed, taken apart and devoured joint by joint.

The villains typically wait patiently for prey to venture out of a city or town before striking, but if a target is particularly tempting, they're willing to risk sneaking into a settlement at night. They kidnap and later enjoy their meals together in a safe location, rather than eating victims on the spot, and they never stay in a single hunting ground for long. While traveling from one city to the next, they eat waylaid travelers and errant farmers, though this is far from their preferred diet.

### Boog

Standing over ten feet tall with a powerful frame, [Boog](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/boog-fleemortals.md) enjoys slaughter and destruction. They sport the head of a rhinoceros, the legs of an elephant, and the arms of a gorilla. Common sense isn't Boog's strong suit and their methods lack subtlety, but they're inarguably effective in battle: Boog charges forward, hits their target until dead or subdued, then moves on to the next.

Boog only speaks in two-word phrases beginning with "Boog": Boog smash. Boog kill. Boog gorge. Because of their large size and lack of subtlety, Boog remains at camp with Ceemal during reconnaissance missions. Ceemal dotes on Boog during these times, and the big monster has begun to treat Ceemal as a child treats a parent.

### Ceemal

[Ceemal](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/ceemal-fleemortals.md) serves as the group's spiritual advisor and butcher. They have the head and back hump of a camel, and the striped legs and rear hooves of a zebra. Though their front limbs show off a camel's cloven hooves, those hooves function as humanoid hands. Thanks to veins infused with octopus blood, Ceemal can easily blend in with their surroundings when danger is close.

Ceemal doesn't go on hunts with the other Abominations, preferring to remain in camp and prepare to break down captured prey. When the Abominations are together, Ceemal looks after the others like a concerned parent, keeping the peace and doting on their friends as seconds are served. Boog holds a particularly special place in Ceemal's heart.

Thanks to their gleaming, wide eyes and nonthreatening herbivore body parts, it's easy to mistake Ceemal for a kind, innocent creature—but as victims beg them for mercy, Ceemal's only response is a precise slice to the jugular from a sharp knife.

### Excess

A monstrous hybrid with an enlarged viper head, scorpion tail, and four giant spider legs, [Excess](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/excess-fleemortals.md)'s appearance terrifies most who encounter them. But the real horror begins when Excess enlarges their head and torso to swallow a humanoid whole.

The sneakiest of the Abominations, Excess can squeeze into tight spaces and climb up sheer walls and ceilings with no equipment. They reconnoiter for the group in sewers, caves, and other dank and dark places.

While they enjoy hunts with their family, Excess is the most independent of the group. They sometime seek their own meal, relishing the challenge of a solo, stealthy pursuit.

### Klar

While Ceemal looks after the Abominations' comforts, [Klar](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/klar-fleemortals.md) leads the hunt. With the noble head of a lion, Klar poses as a heroic celestial being and lures in victims with sweet words, then bisects them with razor-sharp mantis claws. They bound on kangaroo legs through the battlefield, striking enemies then retreating.

Klar also has the shrunken lungs of a whale, the gills of a fish, and the syrinx of a songbird. They can make a variety of unique sounds and noises to distract or frighten enemies.

Recently, Klar has taken an interest in many victims' obsession with prayer, especially in the moments before death. Wondering if the Abominations might be part of some divine creator's plan, Klar even defers their insatiable hunger to discuss divinity and creation with captives. But no victim is so engaging that they avoid Klar's maw forever.

### Sair

Called the Flying Mind Screamer by the rare survivors of Abomination attacks, [Sair](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/sair-fleemortals.md) has the wings and tail of a dragon, the feet of a dinosaur, and the head of an owl. From the sky, they scout prey and find new hunting grounds.

Sair's creators imbued psionic abilities in the flying Abomination. Sair uses these gifts to confuse prey, herding them into the waiting claws of their siblings.

Among the Abominations, Sair is particularly cruel and is often scolded by Ceemal for playing with their food. The winged Abomination loves to taunt their prey before death, sometimes taking victims up to the sky and threatening to drop them.

### Magic Items

Boog carries a magic sphere claimed from a slain wizard, which the Abominations call [Boog's ball](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/boogs-ball-fleemortals.md). At camp, Ceemal always keeps a supply of [poison popper](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/poison-popper-fleemortals.md)s gathered from N'Shalla's garden.

[Boog's Ball](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/boogs-ball-fleemortals.md)

[Poison Popper](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/poison-popper-fleemortals.md)

### Abominations Villain Actions

The Abominations have five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

- **Action 1 Aerial Transport.** Sair moves up to twice their speed. Before or during this move, they can pick up and carry one willing Large Abomination or up to two willing Medium or smaller Abominations who are within 5 feet of them. Sair can release a carried Abomination at any point during the move and must release all carried Abominations at the end of the move. If an Abomination is released while 10 feet or more above the ground, they fall and land [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone), taking the normal 3 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen.  
- **Action 2 Hypnotize.** Excess's eyes turn white as they sway from side to side. Each creature in a 15-foot cone emanating from Excess must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by Excess until the start of Excess's next turn. While charmed in this way, a creature's speed is 0.  
- **Action 3 All You Can Meat.** Ceemal opens the pouch on their waist and throws a chunk of meat to each Abomination they can see within 30 feet of them. Each target who isn't incapacitated can consume the meat and regain 8 (`1d10 + 3`) hit points (no action required).  
- **Action 4 Come and Get It.** Klar moves up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks and makes up to two Mantis Claws attacks. Then each Abomination within 30 feet of Klar who can hear them can move up to their speed toward Klar without provoking opportunity attacks.  
- **Action 5 Boog Stomp.** Boog stomps the ground furiously. Each enemy on the ground within 30 feet of Boog must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage and falling [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) on a failed save, or taking half as much damage and not falling prone on a successful one.  

> [!note] Abominations in Disguise
> 
> Even the stealthiest Abominations have trouble navigating cities to find their next meal or sneak up on the characters while they stay at an inn. If you want the Abominations to enter settlements without setting off alarms, consider giving them access to illusion or transmutation magic, a magic item such as a [hat of disguise](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/hat-of-disguise-xdmg.md), or other features that can allow them to walk freely among people—including the characters—without notice.

If you're running the Abominations against a group that is mostly focused on melee and short-range attacks, give them a fighting chance and have Sair stay closer to the ground.

## Black Iron Pact

*Optimized for Five 7th-Level Characters*

> [!note] Content Warning: Body Horror, Torture, Cannibalism, and Eugenics
> 
> The Black Iron Pact embraces a particularly heinous ideology centered on racism and sexism. Because this evil exists in the real world, roleplaying the Black Iron Pact could make the game unsafe and unfun for some players. Discuss these topics with your group before running the Black Iron Pact to gauge their enthusiasm for taking on such villains. Some players may be eager to take down these bigots, while for others, the injustice might hit too close to reality. You can always change the motivations of the Black Iron Pact, perhaps making them cultists who want to claim the greatest city in the world for a tyrannical deity. That's an evil enough agenda for most heroes to take action!
^content-warning-body-horror-torture-cannibalism-and-eugenics

Racist zealots who wrongly believe in the superiority of humans, the Black Iron Pact conspires in secret to overthrow the multicultural traditions of Capital—proclaimed by its cosmopolitan populace as "the greatest city of this or any age." In their place, the pact plans to institute a harsh theocracy ruled by Ajax the Invincible, the Iron Saint.

### Background

A secret society created to overthrow Capital's political and cultural structure, the Black Iron Pact draws its name from Ajax's sobriquet, the Iron Saint. Iron is a metal with deep symbolism to the tyrannical saint.

The five most powerful members of the pact—the High Command—formally lead the society and serve as its strike team. The identity and whereabouts of the Black Iron Pact's original founder are closely guarded secrets, known only to Ajax and the High Command.

The pact's true numbers also remain a mystery, and many citizens work for them unknowingly. Such subterfuge ensures the pact's agents can't be traced back to the High Command.

### Goals

The Black Iron Pact's primary goal is the conquest of Capital and the installation of Ajax as its ruler and god. The pact's agents are true believers of Ajax's gospel, which seeks change through force and violence. Their evil belief is that humans are the true owners of this world, and as such, only humans can join the Black Iron Pact, though the society employs nonhuman pawns when risk of capture or death is high. Additionally, many members of the pact—notably senior member Erasmus and his wife Avalla—openly sneer at the idea of guilds (essentially scorning everyone in the middle class), and they object to anyone but a human man holding public office, owning any assets, or even learning to read.

To achieve Ajax's conquest, the pact seeks the location of Ringwell, a long-lost ancient repository of powerful and dangerous items from a fallen empire. They intend to plunder the vault and deliver the greatest artifacts to Ajax.

### Methods

The High Command maintains a private demiplane known as the Cyst, a small worldlet only a few miles across which senior members can access through magic items called the [iron ring](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/iron-ring-fleemortals.md)s (see "Magic Items" later in this entry). The Cyst is both a stronghold and a staging area for the pact's combat missions, though most rank-and-file members don't know of its existence.

The leaders of the High Command deal with their enemies as a team, bringing overwhelming force to any conflict. They don't allow any survivors who might report their existence, since High Command includes nobles and guild leaders whose membership in this cult must remain secret.

The Black Iron Pact enacts their plans only after meticulous research and forethought. When members of the High Command assault an objective, they catch their enemies unaware and unprepared, ensuring victory. If things go awry, they can retreat using an [iron ring](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/iron-ring-fleemortals.md).

### Lord Erasmus Deseo

First among equals in the High Command of the Black Iron Pact, [Lord Erasmus Deseo](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lord-erasmus-deseo-fleemortals.md) is the thirteenth Earl Deseo, a minor house under the patronage of House Navarr, Capital's oldest noble family. He represents a small but influential group of Capital nobles who have racist and sexist views.

Aside from the mysterious founder of the pact, Erasmus is its most senior member. He enjoys the camaraderie and has surrounded himself with like-minded people. From his point of view, the pact's vile ideals are popular. Even in polite company, he spits his bigoted views aloud. Though the room is typically divided between those who openly agree and those who remain silent, he's confident even the latter agree with him—for how could anyone disagree with the "facts" that seem so obvious to him? In his warped, evil mind, people who openly speak of equal justice and liberty for all are just pandering to fashion; privately, all wise people surely know this is an Age of Men. Erasmus is so enamored with his own misguided ideals that he doesn't notice how most people barely hide their disgust for him—some out of politeness, others out of fear of the lord's power.

### Canon Athenodorus

After moving to Capital as a teen, [Canon Athenodorus](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/canon-athenodorus-fleemortals.md) the Unalloyed joined the Church of Saint Pellario the Aspirant, eventually rising to become a mid-level church official. While he publicly preaches the words of Saint Pellario, patron saint of ambition, he privately works to convert his fellows to the Church of Ajax. According to him, several Knights of the Black Glove—an order sponsored by the Church of Saint Pellario—are sympathetic to Ajax's tyrannical teachings.

The Knights of the Black Glove are considered the greatest in Capital. If Athenodorus could indeed convert them to allies of the Black Iron Pact, Ajax's conquest of Capital would be all but assured.

### Cloak

The High Command's master of assassins, [Cloak](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/cloak-fleemortals.md)'s identity is a carefully guarded secret. She approached Lord Erasmus Deseo and demanded entry into the society after discovering the identity of the High Command and making her way into the Cyst without an [iron ring](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/iron-ring-fleemortals.md). The brash move so impressed the leader of the Black Iron Pact that he accepted her offer and terms of anonymity.

Cloak plans the Black Iron Pact's operations alongside Lord Erasmus. It is usually Cloak who gathers intelligence, pays people off, and ensures there are no surprises or hidden variables when the High Command strikes. Their victories can largely be credited to her immaculate preparation. Members of the High Command speculate that Cloak is a highly ranked and well-connected member of one of the major guilds in the city.

### Lady Avalla Deseo

Lady Avalla Deseo, wife of Lord Erasmus, helped shape the Black Iron Pact's sinister rhetoric, especially where it concerns women. She preaches these backward ideals about gender passionately and defers to her husband at home and in the Cyst.

The fact that Avalla is also a high-ranking wizard at the Imperial College of Sorcery and possessed of great knowledge and authority doesn't seem at all contradictory to her (or her husband). Many of her colleagues have no respect for her views, but her power can't be denied. Students quickly learn that those who brashly question Avalla's evil ideals get kicked out of the college for fabricated reasons.

Through great toil and experimentation, Avalla has modified her [iron ring](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/iron-ring-fleemortals.md) to be more useful. She can activate it quickly in times of distress and use it to transport other members of the pact who wear the ring.

### Qar, Master of Jackals

[Qar](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qar-master-of-jackals-fleemortals.md) boarded the *Priceless Pearl* when the Riojan caravel docked in the port city of Kom-nefer in Khemhara. He served for many years as a warrior and sailor, until he and his shipmates battled powerful sorcerers aboard the *Ainsurabaloc*. Qar found himself alone and unarmed, facing a monk from Higara with tattoos of demonic jackals covering her skin. By a stroke of luck, Qar defeated the monk and unwittingly absorbed her power, title, and technique. Now Qar is the Master of Jackals.

He left the service of the *Priceless Pearl* when they next docked in Capital, joining the District Watch. Using his ill-gotten abilities, he rose to the rank of captain. Following a particularly brutal encounter on the street, Qar was quoted in the broadsheets saying, "The smell and filth of the city are overwhelming." This brought him to the attention of the Black Iron Pact, and Lord Deseo personally recruited him for the High Command.

Qar takes special delight in unnecessary cruelty, and on the battlefield, he uses his mobility to kill unconscious foes where they lie before allies can heal them.

### Magic Items

All members of the High Command of the Black Iron Pact wear an [iron ring](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/iron-ring-fleemortals.md). Athenodorus wields the [star of iron](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/star-of-iron-fleemortals.md).

### Black Iron Pact Villain Actions

The Black Iron Pact has five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

- **Action 1 Party Tactics.** Qar and each ally within 60 feet of him who can see or hear him can move up to their speed.  
- **Action 2 Curse of Iron.** Athenodorus unleashes a magic hex. Each enemy he can see within 30 feet of him must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 14 (`4d6`) necrotic damage and is [blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't blinded.  
- **Action 3 Promised Storm.** Avalla fires a bolt of lightning at a creature she can see within 90 feet of her. The bolt then leaps from that target to up to two other creatures of her choice within 30 feet of the first target. Each target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (`4d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Action 4 Assassin's Strike.** Cloak moves up to her speed then makes a Shortsword attack against a creature within her reach. On a hit, the attack deals 33 (`6d10`) piercing damage instead of its normal damage, and it doesn't inflict the [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition. On a miss, the attack deals half as much damage.  
- **Action 5 Playtime's Over.** Erasmus barks a command to a member of the High Command within 60 feet of him who can hear him. The target can use their villain party action even if they have already used it during this encounter.  
- > [!note] Retreat to the Cyst  
    >   
    > Each member of the Black Iron Pact's High Command can use their [Iron Ring](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/iron-ring-fleemortals.md) action to teleport out of a losing battle. You can utilize this action the first time one or more of the villains is cornered by the characters and needs a quick exit. This display will make the characters aware of how the members of the Black Iron Pact can teleport out of danger, giving the characters a chance to prepare countermeasures for the next encounter. When fighting together, the members of the High Command generally don't retreat until at least one of them has fallen.

## Wilderkith

*Optimized for Five 9th-Level Characters*

> [!note] Content Warning: Terrorism
> 
> The Wilderkith are evil villains who use fear to advance their agenda. They not only destroy structures built by expansive civilizations, but they kill indiscriminately to force people to flee cities. If you or your players don't enjoy playing games with terrorism, you can have the Wilderkith plan their attacks more strategically and surgically. Have them wait until a building is empty before demolishing it, and only kill the powerful politicians and leaders who push for expansion, mining, and cutting down trees.
^content-warning-terrorism

Some see nature as all-encompassing chaos. Others believe it a precious balance. And some believe nature walks among us with a bloody vision—a future free of human civilization. This incarnation is Anthracia, a dryad bent on revenge. She leads a force of nature's bloody avengers that she calls the Wilderkith.

### Background

When mortals felled the first forest in the Mundane World to make way for a road, Anthracia laid waste to them for daring to harm the natural world. For her crime, a council of archfey imprisoned her in the Gemhollow—an ancient crystal deep in Arcadia, the realm of fey. For millennia, she watched as civilizations sprang up and hurt nature in their attempts to tame it. Her rage and desire for vengeance festered until a group of curious elves broke her free.

The vengeful dryad appealed to the elves, plants, and forest fey to help her save the Mundane World from humanoid expansion. Those who saw wisdom in the dryad's words left Arcadia with Anthracia to begin a bloody campaign.

### Goals

The Wilderkith's Inner Circle leads an army to destroy civilization's blight, razing roads, dams, farms, and even schools. To this band, burning a city is an act of pure good, as the ash makes way for the next generation of plants so the cycle of nature can continue.

The Wilderkith despise those who cut down trees, dig mines, or otherwise try to tame or take from the land. Their doctrine holds no hope for such people, believing them destined to destroy themselves and the world around them.

Ultimately, the Wilderkith know they aren't as powerful as all the major civilizations of the Mundane World. Their vandalism alone can't turn the tide, but no other group possesses the courage to end the disease of civilization. The Wilderkith seek any power that can help them restore untamed wilderness, rule over it, and prevent the rise of future civilizations.

### Methods

The Wilderkith rely on guerilla warfare, using their understanding of the land to their advantage. They strike poorly defended settlements in the dead of night, destroying all they can before retreating into the forest, then back to the Gemhollow. This crystal prison once held Anthracia, but the Wilderkith turned it into a fortress—one they can ritually summon to a new location.

Occasionally, the Wilderkith set their sights on bigger targets, using destruction to send a message to those who think they're safe behind tall stone walls. Rapid plant growth reclaiming fresh ruins is a common Wilderkith calling card.

### Anthracia, Princess of Venom

Captivating to her followers and cruel to her enemies, the dryad [Anthracia](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/anthracia-princess-of-venom-fleemortals.md) delights in the demise of those she sees as a threat to the beasts and plants of the wilderness. To the self-styled Princess of Venom, murder is a simple part of the natural cycle. The beings who serve her are spared her wrath only because of their connection to the natural world, but she feels all her followers are ultimately expendable.

Anthracia's dryad tree is hidden deep inside Gemhollow. She zealously guards the tree, allowing no other creature but Logger into the chamber.

Anthracia controls the battlefield from afar, using her supernatural connection to the earth to lock down terrain and manipulate the movement of enemies and allies.

### Logger

Made from the vines and branches of Anthracia's tree, [Logger](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/logger-fleemortals.md) dutifully follows the dryad like a puppy. The humaniform plant has never left her side and was imprisoned with Anthracia for thousands of years.

Logger's docile demeanor cracks into violent rage when Anthracia commands them to attack. Once set loose, the plant can be hard to control; imbued with the wild fury of nature itself, they're prone to rampaging and trampling friend and foe alike.

Logger excels at diving into combat headfirst, ready to soak up damage for the Wilderkith and pin down as many targets as possible.

### Sylphise

Ethereal, unsettling, and above all alien, [Sylphise](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/sylphise-fleemortals.md) serves as Anthracia's second-in-command. Those who glimpse this forest nymph recall the sight with more fear than awe, retelling a riveting nightmare of impossibly long limbs, taloned fingers, and wide, soul-piercing eyes.

Sylphise treats most other creatures as insects beneath her notice or toys for her amusement. Even elves and fey find her hard to fathom, and many whisper to each other that the nymph's chaotic nature is a liability—but none would suggest this to Anthracia, as the dryad and nymph are utterly committed to each other.

And no one can argue with her results on the field. Sylphise strikes fast as a snake, weaving through combat like a dancer, leaving terror in her wake.

### Tuval-Uthriar

[Tuval-Uthriar](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/tuval-uthriar-fleemortals.md) was once a proud commander of a paladin order, but after a land baron invaded his family's ancient lands and killed his son, he left his post to train Anthracia's forces. The elf took a new oath, swearing to become an instrument of vengeance against the hubris of civilization. He is the newest member of the Inner Circle, and has lived his whole life in the Mundane World.

The veteran tactician believes in the Wilderkith's mission to destroy humanity and thus prevent the slow decay of the natural world. However, when ordered to harm another elf, he can't help but see his family's faces, and he struggles to obey.

In addition to Tuval-Uthriar's limited healing abilities, he supports the Wilderkith by drawing fire and forming a solid front line.

### Vali

A once-celebrated hunter condemned by his people for fratricide, [Vali](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/vali-fleemortals.md) serves as a prized scout and assassin for the Wilderkith. The elf excels at picking off enemies from the treetops with his magic longbow.

Vali took a vow of silence after his excommunication, but his face is etched with a clear set of priorities. He lives for the kill and feels happiest while watching a body topple. Each death never comes fast enough for the bloodthirsty assassin.

In combat, Vali is hard to find and harder to hit. He has plenty of options for getting out of a tight spot, making him a particularly slippery damage-dealer.

### Magic Items

Tuval-Uthriar wields a magic gauntlet called [eye of sunrise](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/eye-of-sunrise-fleemortals.md), and Vali wields a magic longbow called [waning moon](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/waning-moon-fleemortals.md).

[Eye of Sunrise](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/eye-of-sunrise-fleemortals.md)

[Waning Moon](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/waning-moon-fleemortals.md)

### Wilderkith Villain Actions

The Wilderkith have five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

- **Action 1 Liquid Earth.** Each creature within 60 feet of Anthracia must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be moved by her up to 15 feet horizontally. A target can choose to fail this saving throw.  
- **Action 2 Distracting Tendrils.** Logger waves their tendrils wildly. Each enemy within 30 feet of them must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 22 (`4d10`) slashing damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of the target's next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.  
- **Action 3  Blood-Soaked Daisies.** Sylphise moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks. She can make one Claw attack against each enemy she passes within 5 feet of during this move.  
- **Action 4 Tactical Push.** Tuval-Uthriar shouts a command. Each member of the Inner Circle within 60 feet of him who can hear him can make an attack or move up to their speed (no action required).  
- **Action 5 Suppressing Volley.** Vali makes a ranged attack against each enemy he can see within 150 feet of him, and each member of the Inner Circle can move up to their speed and take the Hide action (no action required).

## Amethyst Knife

*Optimized for Five 11th-Level Characters*

After an adventuring expedition went wrong, the adventurers attained strange psionic powers. Using their newfound abilities, they built the criminal syndicate known as the Amethyst Knife. Striving to become one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations across the known world, the syndicate's ruthless and selfish leaders manipulate rival factions, heads of state, and other powerful individuals to place them under the syndicate's sway.

### Background

Five years ago, famed halfling actor and adventurer Harlo Honeygrin put together an expedition to seek an ancient ruin and its rumored relics of an alien civilization. Harlo and his expedition discovered a dagger made of a purple crystal unlike anything they had seen before. When they removed the strange weapon from its stone dais, thunderous energy collapsed the vault and shattered the dagger, releasing an explosive pulse of violet psionic power.

After recovering from the blast and escaping the ruins, the five survivors found they had acquired strange new powers and a shared telepathic link. With this new development, Harlo revealed his true nature as the head of a small criminal organization. He convinced the others to use their new powers to help grow and expand his group's influence—in exchange for a share of the profits and power, of course. They renamed the organization after the strange alien relic that had gifted them new powers and opportunities, and together, they reforged Harlo's small criminal enterprise into a blossoming underworld syndicate.

### Goals

The Amethyst Knife seeks three things above all: wealth, influence, and control. They're willing to acquire these through any means necessary, caring little for who gets hurt or what must be sacrificed in the process. To the Knife, the ends always justify the means.

The syndicate is always expanding their network of spies, informants, and in-pocket influential figures. Most recently, the Amethyst Knife set their sights on the noble houses of the great port city of Capital, dispatching spies and underlings to infiltrate those houses and discover new opportunities.

### Methods

The Amethyst Knife builds its wealth in every criminal scheme imaginable: smuggling, protection fees, assassination contracts, and more. Its bosses then invest the money from these criminal enterprises into legitimate businesses—which prove remarkably profitable, thanks to the Knife coercing local leaders to make favorable laws and scaring the competition out of the game.

While the bosses of the Amethyst Knife let nothing stand in their way, they avoid attracting too much attention. The group uses subterfuge and pawns to avoid the ire of law enforcement and so-called heroes. Bribing or blackmailing prominent figures, subverting laws and contracts, threatening loved ones, and manipulating marks into desperate situations are all common tactics.

When subtle manipulations fail, the Amethyst Knife strikes their foes with swift, merciless violence. Minor threats and obstacles can be resolved with freelance assassins or mercenaries, but serious opposition merits intervention from the Knife's bosses. Using their psionic powers, shared minds, and varied skill sets, they wait for a vulnerable moment. If an attack goes awry, the Amethyst Knife fades into the shadows to find a better approach—such as slowly picking off a rival group one by one.

### Harlo Honeygrin

Though [Harlo Honeygrin](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/harlo-honeygrin-fleemortals.md) approaches his one hundred and twentieth birthday, he retains his appearance as a halfling man in the prime of youth with exceptional good looks. His public image paints him as a charming, heroic lover of the arts, but in truth, Harlo is a jealous, spiteful reprobate who secretly created a criminal enterprise to fulfill his vain and desperate needs.

Over eighty years ago, Harlo forged a deal with Barresqueth, an archfey who offered the destitute halfling fame, power, and beauty in exchange for a payment of treasure every three years. After forging the pact, Harlo built the life of theater and adventure he'd always wanted—but when his first payment came due, Harlo learned Barresqueth would increase the price every three years. As the fee grew, Harlo resorted to criminal means to obtain it.

Each time Barresqueth collects the debt from Harlo, the archfey assumes the guise of a swashbuckling mouse with an eyepatch. Passersby assume the little rodent is Harlo's adorable fey friend, which only irks the halfling more as he forks over a sack of riches to the greedy little mouse.

Harlo maintains his life as a famous actor, using it to build connections within the societies the Knife seeks to control. When forced into action, he uses his powers from hiding while the other bosses go toe-to-toe with opponents.

### Jutkarr Flintfingers

Though [Jutkarr Flintfingers](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/jutkarr-flintfingers-fleemortals.md) is a devotee of Ragilo, a god venerated by thieves and assassins, he doesn't consider himself a scoundrel. In fact, the grandfatherly dwarf actively dislikes most thieves, calling them lazy cheats and cocky liars. Jutkarr instead considers himself a "problem solver" and believes that any true follower of Ragilo is the same. To him, there's little difference between solving the daily word puzzle in the city broadsheet and "solving" a guarded mansion, a warded treasure vault, or the social complexities of a street gang war. Each is merely a pleasant distraction and chance to keep his wits sharp.

Harlo hired Jutkarr for his expedition as an expert intraps and locks. After the founding of the Amethyst Knife,  Jutkarr became the syndicate's quartermaster and tactician. He oversees most operations with his cunning intellect and insight.

### Llyvessa

[Llyvessa](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/llyvessa-fleemortals.md), She-Who-Leaps-Across-Moonlight, is the most mysterious member of the Amethyst Knife. The elf's otherworldly appearance shifts between alluring and terrifying. She usually speaks in cryptic Elvish phrases and metaphors that most find impossible to comprehend.

Llyvessa and Harlo met when the guide for Harlo's soon-to-launch expedition mysteriously went missing and she appeared as a last-minute replacement. When the group discovered the crystal dagger, Llyvessa was struck with an overwhelming fear and awe, as though she could see something the others could not. Since then, she has followed the others' orders without question and has made no effort to share her own feelings or ambitions. Her true intentions in the organization remain a mystery.

As a deadly sharpshooter, Llyvessa serves as one of the Amethyst Knife's top assassins, killing with a detached, calculating efficiency.

### Treyvan von Hirnschmann

[Treyvan von Hirnschmann](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/treyvan-von-hirnschmann-fleemortals.md) is the illegitimate half-elf son of Duke Zaltz von Hirnschmann, a minor but influential human noble. To prove himself worthy of a noble title—and of his father's love—Treyvan set out to seek his own fortune. He eventually crossed blades with Victory Graves in a duel, and though Treyvan lost, Vic saw potential in him. Instead of killing the man, she offered him a job on an expedition led by her employer Harlo Honeygrin.

After the expedition, Treyvan initially declined Harlo's offer to join the Amethyst Knife, intending to head home and use his new powers to prove himself to his father. However, Harlo and Victory brought Treyvan evidence of an assassination plot against him—one orchestrated by his father the duke, who hoped to remove Treyvan as a threat to his younger half-sibling's title. Crushed and enraged at the betrayal, Treyvan agreed to join the Amethyst Knife. Seeking revenge, he plans to use the criminal empire to usurp control of his father's domain.

> [!note] Humanoid Ability Scores Above 20
> 
> The Humanoids in the Amethyst Knife, Soulbinders, and Hallowed Dark have ability scores above 20. Each party has experienced an accident or event that made its members superhuman and bound their fates together.
^humanoid-ability-scores-above-20

### Victory "Vic" Graves

[Victory](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/victory-graves-fleemortals.md) grew up in a rough orphanage that forced her onto the streets as soon as the young human could feed and dress herself. Her childhood instilled what she considers life's most valuable lesson: "The weak think someone will save them. The strong think others will fear them. The clever think everyone beneath them. In the end, it's the ruthless who survive."

Vic learned to fight as soon as she could lift a blade, and she honed her skills in vicious backroom fighting pits and bloody alleyway brawls. She delights in luring foes into oneon-one duels with her, where her sharp reflexes and precise strikes prove deadly. These skills earned her employment as a bodyguard for Harlo when he began his criminal career. Long before the founding of the Amethyst Knife, Vic recognized Harlo's true nature and the commonality in their merciless and selfish values, and she agreed to serve as his second-in-command, a position she has held ever since.

### Magic Items

After returning from their fateful expedition, two members of the Amethyst Knife used the shattered remains of the crystal dagger to forge psionic items for themselves.

### Amethyst Knife Villain Actions

The Amethyst Knife has five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

- **Action 1 Amethyst Formation.** Treyvan telekinetically moves each willing Amethyst Knife boss who he can see within 60 feet of him up to 30 feet in any direction.  
- **Action 2 Leaves Fall on the Moon.** Llyvessa shoots an arrow charged with psionic potential, creating a line of psionic energy that is 5 feet wide and 150 feet long. Each enemy in that area must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Action 3 I Planned For This.** Jutkarr issues a coded telepathic instruction and psionically manipulates the space around him. Each Amethyst Knife boss within 60 feet of him can teleport and swap spaces with another willing Amethyst Knife boss in that area (no action required). Each teleporting creature must be able to see the creature they're swapping spaces with.  
- **Action 4 Telepathic Tirade.** Victory telepathically taunts one creature she can see within 30 feet of her. Until the end of the target's next turn, they have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, and they take 5 (`1d10`) psychic damage whenever they fail an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.  
- **Action 5 Epilogue.** Harlo unleashes a chain of psionic fury. Each enemy within 60 feet of him must make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 28 (`8d6`) psychic damage and is [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed) until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed).

## Soulbinders

*Optimized for Five 13th-Level Characters*

> [!note] Content Warning: Possession
> 
> The Soulbinders are a once-humanoid collective transformed into sapient, cursed magic items. They possess, transform, and burn the life force of their wielders. If your group would rather avoid the topic of possession, you can instead make the Soulbinders power-hungry warriors whose magic weapons draw on their own life force.
^content-warning-possession

The timeless quest for immortality takes countless forms, many of which serve as cautionary tales. In the case of the Soulbinders, their ignorance and greed bound their souls into cursed items that feed off the life force of their wielders.

### Background

Millennia ago, the Soulbinders were a mortal band of explorers. Prince Ellan Farra traveled with his sage advisor, a duo of mercenaries, and a spelunker guide to find their eternal reward—a scroll containing an ancient ritual to grant immortality.

When the party found the ancient text, their ambition blinded them to the ritual's true cost. Each explorer offered a personal treasure, expecting the ritual to consume it. Instead, as the scroll disintegrated, the spell destroyed their bodies and trapped their souls in these objects. Worse, the Soulbinders learned that to fuel their power and truly experience immortal life, they must consume the souls of others, puppeteering the body of each unsuspecting victim until their life force burns out.

### Goals

No record shows how long the Soulbinders have existed, and even they have long forgotten. Unsatisfied with their cursed existence, their hunger remains unsated, for their immortality means nothing without power. The Soulbinders have resolved to achieve godhood, escape their prisons, and elevate their souls to a higher existence.

The Soulbinders believe that in forcing people to worship them as gods, they will in fact become gods. Their main goal is to bring new lands and peoples under their control, then use those resources to acquire even more. The group also searches for new sources of magical power that might hasten their deification.

### Methods

The Soulbinders' unquenchable ambitions and dark magics often require the sacrifice of innocents or other unspeakable acts of violence.

To function, each Soulbinder also needs a body to possess and transform into their old self—and to acquire such a body, a hapless mortal must attune to the cursed item that binds the villain's soul. Once possessed, the victim remains distressingly aware of their former body's actions. The Soulbinders who have obtained bodies aid those who lack one, often by offering unsuspecting adventurers a cursed item as a reward or by planting it where it might be discovered by a chosen traveler. After possessing a user, the victim's soul is consumed over time and the bodies eventually burn out into dust.

***Blackstone Manor.*** The Soulbinders operate from a fortified mansion they call Blackstone Manor, built from the old temple ruins where they first discovered the cursed ritual. A secret passage in the manor's cellar hides the Walk of Bones, an ancient vault and shrine bearing walls inlaid with ash and bone fragments from the Soulbinders' possessed victims.

### Argan Rael

Obsessed with uncovering forbidden magical secrets, [Argan Rael](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/argan-rael-fleemortals.md) was shunned by every mage circle he approached for help. Seeking to make fools of his detractors, the tiefling made a desperate case to Prince Ellan Farra, promising to find the secrets of immortality. Taken by the idea of ruling eternally, the prince agreed to support Argan and called for the execution of those who doubted the mage's wisdom.

While knowledge is Argan's passion, his biggest thrill is causing suffering and subjugation. He is loyal to the Soulbinders but takes orders only from Prince Ellan.

The callous wizard prefers to possess other spellcasters, and he resides within the [bracers of the spellbreaker](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/bracers-of-the-spellbreaker-fleemortals.md).

### Kishina Darrowind

When [Kishina Darrowind](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/kishina-darrowind-fleemortals.md) was just a young half-elf, her homeland was invaded by the long-lived elf Oramac. She vowed to make the commander pay for his crimes and to outlive him and his kin. Retreating into the wilderness, Kishina struck and killed small bands of Oramac's forces when she could, but as age took its toll on her, her vow for eternal vengeance seemed an angry child's dream. One day, however, Prince Ellan Farra arrived at her door in need of a guide to an ancient ruin.

Now a conqueror herself, Kishina barely thinks about the vengeance she swore or the home she lost. She has become level-headed and dispassionate, willing to justify any action as a means to an end. Godhood is her only passion, though if she could be reminded of how she felt about conquerors in days past, she might hate what she has become.

Kishina is bound to her [pathfinder's boots](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/pathfinders-boots-fleemortals.md) and wishes to learn the origin of the ritual that changed her. Was it planar magic? The act of a trickster god? Or something even more unfathomable? If she could find that answer, she's confident she would not only understand that power, but perhaps even learn to wield it.

### Prince Ellan Farra

King Garrow Farra always saw [Prince Ellan](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/prince-ellan-farra-fleemortals.md), his eldest child, for what he was: a power-hungry narcissist. When Garrow declared that Ellan's younger siblings would take the crown, the elf prince's narcissism turned to fury. Ellan went to war with his father and siblings—and nearly lost. Before he could finish doing so, however, Ellan learned of Argan's research and the chance at immortality it offered. Ellan abandoned his decimated armies in favor of a new plan: he would become immortal, go into hiding, and outlive his pathetic siblings before emerging to claim the throne forever.

Countless years have passed, and finally, the prince stands ready to seize the throne his father ripped from his hands. But his ambitions have broadened, and now the throne is simply one rung on the ladder to Ellan's godhood.

Though pretentious, callous, and selfish, Ellan is no fool. Both methodical and ruthless, he seeks not only control, but the reverence he believes his due. Ellan is bound to the [crown of majesty](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/crown-of-majesty-fleemortals.md), a magic circlet whose name befits the prince's ego.

### Radlee "The Grim" Thugram

[Radlee Thugram](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/radlee-thugram-fleemortals.md) was one of the countless human subjects who King Garrow conscripted and sent to war against the forces of Prince Ellan. Radlee's unit perished when her ruthless commander set them up as bait in an enemy ambush. Thanks to Radlee's quick thinking, she was the only survivor—and she celebrated her escape by returning to camp and murdering her commander.

After that, Radlee deserted and became a sellsword, quickly earning a frightening reputation. The few survivors of her brutality often simply called her "the Grim." The bloody road of mercenary work led Radlee into partnership with the Scarlet Shadow, a mysterious assassin for hire. Their infamy grew, and one day, the very prince Radlee had been forced to fight came inquiring about a job exploring a remote ruin.

Radlee is cold and matter-of-fact, and despises social platitudes—traits which sometimes put her at odds with the prince. In combat, she is ferocious and unrelenting, protecting her fellow Soulbinders while showing no mercy to her enemies. She is bound to the [visionary's cloak](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/visionarys-cloak-fleemortals.md).

### Scarlet Shadow

[Scarlet Shadow](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/scarlet-shadow-fleemortals.md) doesn't share his name or background. Only the dragonborn's closest friend, Radlee Thugram, knows he once belonged to an assassin's guild that bore his name. After a bloody guild war left Scarlet as his organization's only survivor, he took on the guild's name as his own and became an independent contract killer. Eventually, Scarlet joined forces with Radlee and then the rest of the Soulbinders.

Long before Scarlet's curse, he'd already lost most of his humanity. Killing is his only purpose and sadistic pleasure, and he doesn't want to be just any god—he wants to be the god of death. The assassin is bound to the [ring of scarlet shadows](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/ring-of-scarlet-shadows-fleemortals.md), the last symbol of his old guild.

### Magic Items

Each Soulbinder wears a magic item that houses their eternal soul:

- [Argan Rael](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/argan-rael-fleemortals.md): [bracers of the spellbreaker](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/bracers-of-the-spellbreaker-fleemortals.md)  
- [Kishina Darrowind](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/kishina-darrowind-fleemortals.md): [pathfinder's boots](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/pathfinders-boots-fleemortals.md)  
- [Prince Ellan Farra](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/prince-ellan-farra-fleemortals.md): [crown of majesty](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/crown-of-majesty-fleemortals.md)  
- [Radlee "The Grim" Thugram](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/radlee-thugram-fleemortals.md): [ visionary's cloak](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/visionarys-cloak-fleemortals.md)  
- [Scarlet Shadow](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/scarlet-shadow-fleemortals.md): [ring of scarlet shadows](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/ring-of-scarlet-shadows-fleemortals.md)  

If a Soulbinder's body is killed, their magic item can be recovered as treasure. In addition to the properties listed in the magic item descriptions, each item has the following two properties.

***Sentience.*** This magic item is sentient. Its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores match the corresponding persona's stat block.

This magic item has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. It can speak, read, and understand the languages in its persona's stat block, and it can communicate telepathically with its wearer.

***Curse.*** Once you attune to this item, you can't end your attunement to it unless you are targeted by the [remove curse](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/remove-curse-xphb.md) spell or similar magic. Seven days after you attune to it, you must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, your Wisdom score is reduced by 1 for as long as you remain attuned to the item. You must repeat this saving throw every 24 hours while you remain attuned to the item.

If you fail this saving throw three times, the magic item possesses your body, and your soul becomes trapped in your body. Your body transforms into the original body of the soul within the magic item, and your statistics change to match the persona in control of your new body. While possessed, your equipment transforms into the equipment used by the possessing persona's stat block. You sense everything your body can sense, but the persona controls your movement, speech, and actions.

If you end your attunement to the magic item, your body returns to its original form, you regain control of your body, and the magic item's soul returns to the magic item. If you die, the magic item's soul returns to the magic item. If your body is possessed for `1d6 + 12` months, your soul is destroyed, your body crumbles to dust, and you die.

> [!note] It's Not Me!
> 
> Even after a Soulbinder's magic item settles its curse on a new victim, the Soulbinder must wait until the victim's will weakens enough for possession. In the meantime, the Soulbinder builds a friendly relationship with their wearer, striving to convince them that the curse is caused by some other magical force in their life. Since the ill effects of the curse don't manifest for days, it's usually easy to blame the curse on other newly acquired objects or recent events.

However, since each Soulbinder is the item they wear, they can harness the power more effectively than their magic item's normal statistics allow. This makes the Soulbinders powerful villains and simplifies their stat blocks. This means you don't need to track charges or worry about a cloak's hood remaining up during combat.

### Soulbinders Villain Actions

The Soulbinders have five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

- **Action 1 Battle Cry.** Ellan unleashes a cacophonous battle cry. Each enemy within 60 feet of him who can hear him must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the end of their next turn.  
- **Action 2 Strategic Positioning.** Radlee and each ally within 60 feet of her who can see or hear her can move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks and take the Hide action.  
- **Action 3 Furious Dance.** Kishina unleashes a flurry of spinning attacks against each enemy she can see within 15 feet of her. Each target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 22 (`5d8`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a successful save, they take half as much damage and aren't knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).  
- **Action 4 Gravity Bomb.** Argan creates an explosion of negative energy centered on a point he can see within 90 feet of him. Each enemy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (`6d10`) force damage and their speed is reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half as much damage and their speed isn't reduced.  
- **Action 5 Shadow Shift.** Scarlet Shadow teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see and makes one Shadow Blade or Razor Garrote attack with advantage. If the attack hits, it is a critical hit.  

> [!note] Ending the Curse for Good
> 
> The characters might wish to permanently uncurse the Soulbinders' magic items to free the souls trapped within the items, or to make the items usable without the threat of possession. At your discretion, the characters can permanently remove the Sentience and Curse properties of each item by finding a second copy of the ritual scroll that trapped the Soulbinders. Performing this ritual near all five items restores each Soulbinder's original body and transfers their souls out of the items back into their bodies. After this occurs, the scroll is reduced to ash and the Sentience and Curse properties of each item are removed.

## Hallowed Dark

*Optimized for Five 15th-Level Characters*

> [!note] Content Warning: Terrorism, Torture, and Blood
> 
> As the Hallowed Dark prepares the world for the return of the dragon [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md), they instill fear through destruction, murder, and torture.

^content-warning-terrorism-torture-and-blood

For every adventurer standing against the oncoming dark, there is a fervid wretch seeking the world's annihilation. Five such zealots serve the gloom dragon [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md). Empowered by drinking the wyrm's blood, the apocalypse cult of the Hallowed Dark now seeks to usher in the Silent Decay's reign of suffocating darkness.

### Background

For many, the Sun Eater was a figure of mere myth and nightmare—but not for Aronar and Athmia Valkys, halfelf twins born under an eclipse. Every birthday brought them whispered promises of power and visions of a dragon swallowing the sun. The twins traveled deep to a forgotten underground temple where they found vials of [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md)'s blood. In a profane ritual, the twins each consumed a vial of blood; in return, [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) set one of the wyrm's eyes in each of their heads, granting them supernatural powers. The wyrm also bestowed magical rings on the twins as a mark of favor.

Though Aronar and Athmia were [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md)'s first priests of the modern age, the dragon sent similar whispers to three more chosen. Each arrived at the slumbering wyrm's church and gained a dragon's blessings: the tiefling Caithas grew wings, Vivienn's human body was empowered with dragon sinew, and Draven's human blood was replaced with that of a dragon.

Together, they are the Hallowed Dark—and they will expunge every trace of light from this world.

### Goals

The Hallowed Dark ultimately wish to restore [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) to power and end this wretched world. In exchange, the dragon promises dominion over the shadowed world to come.

Methodical, patient, and cruel, the cultists know the path to the lightless world is a long and arduous one—and in the meantime, they relish the suffering they inflict on their path to forever dark. This apocalypse cult commands as much terror as the Sun Eater they seek to reawaken, becoming nightmares for all who cross their path.

### Methods

[Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) communicates intermittently with the Hallowed Dark through visions, dreams, and impressions, drawing their priests to dark corners of the world. In these remote places, the cult enacts a series of costly and prolonged rituals to reawaken the Silent Decay. The rituals require rare, void-touched components: fallen stars and meteorites, the hearts or minds of eldritch entities, deep-mined iron wielded by those who travel between planes, and more.

Meanwhile, the cult spreads darkness and fear. They believe terror crushes hope, and without hope, people  will buckle when the end approaches. The Hallowed Dark has committed many atrocities—terrorist attacks on temples and government buildings, destruction of systems that provide societal structure and safety, wanton slaughter, and torture of those they bother to leave alive. If the whimpering mortals they spare go wailing to others about [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md)'s return—well, all the better.

### Aronar Valkys

[Aronar Valkys](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/aronar-valkys-fleemortals.md) is a prodigy spellcaster, born under an eclipse and rumored to have thieved magic from the gods themselves in the night. The half-elf keeps no holy symbol and worships at no temple, yet he commanded divine magic long before he supped on [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md)'s blood. Aronar scorns spellcasters who chain themselves to the gods, claiming that the secrets of heaven await anyone cunning enough to claim them.

He proudly wields the right eye of [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md), which grants the gift of clarity of mind and the wisdom of dragons. It was [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md)'s promises of knowledge that drew Aronar to follow them—he saw visions of himself and Athmia shaping the new world with magic no mortal possessed, becoming figures of unimaginable nightmare.

Aronar's calm demeanor belies his arrogance and narcissism. He longs for nothing more than unchecked dominion in the new world. Cunning and careful, the halfelf sees all with his draconic eye and bides his time.

### Athmia Valkys

While Aronar lusts after the mastery of magic, [Athmia](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/athmia-valkys-fleemortals.md) needs no grand display to kill, just a single touch on her victim's mind. From childhood, she was a silent killer, rending the minds of small animals to sharpen her cognitive blades. Her arts of mental assassination allow her to tear down mental barriers and gouge out secrets without lifting a hand, leaving behind corpses with bleeding ears.

Her discretion and lethality earned her [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md)'s left eye, a gift of shrewdness and stealth. In her visions, she saw her dark gifts praised, her ascendancy assured—and power, so much power for her insatiable mind.

Athmia allows Aronar to act as the cult's outward-facing "leader," but they work as equals—Aronar the politicking manipulator, Athmia the blade in the dark. During the rare times she speaks, she shows herself to be merciless, cold, and wholly devoted to the end of the world.

### Caithas

Born from a deal with a devil, [Caithas](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/caithas-fleemortals.md)'s mother hid him from the militantly devout people of his small hometown. The tiefling lived under the floors of his mother's house, nurturing his creativity and filling those dark spaces with drawings of what he imagined the world looked like.

Then, at the age of eleven, he was discovered. The prejudiced people of the town chased Caithas into the wilds, where he nearly starved before learning to forage. During those dark months, [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) spoke to him in dreams. The gloom dragon taught him not only to hunt and survive, but to thrive. As Caithas grew, he became a keen hunter, and the mysterious dragon in his dreams was his sole friend.

Caithas was the first cultist Aronar and Athmia welcomed into the fold. While Caithas lacks the depth of the others' cruelty and ambitions, [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) has spent a lifetime filling his head with dreams of a beautiful, shadowed world, and his loyalty to the dragon runs deep. Caithas often falls into wry humor that turns to mockery, a reflection of his deep distrust of mortalkind. He watches his back, even around the other cultists, and trusts only [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) with his safety.

### Draven Malas

Had vengeance not consumed him so deeply, [Draven Malas](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/draven-malas-fleemortals.md) would've been heralded as a paragon. A prominent government figure and a sorcerer of some renown, he dabbled in blood magic, certain he would never be drawn into its tempting darkness. But when his son died in a bandit attack, Draven snapped. He hunted down the bandits and the guards who failed to protect his boy, cursing their blood and boiling each offender from the inside. He was branded a murderer and fled.

Lost in grief, Draven was perfectly vulnerable when [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) gave him dreams—visions of a world where no evils would go unpunished, where Draven's fury was righteous and right. These visions guided him to the cult.

[Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) gave Draven the weightiest blessing of all, the blessing of blood. After nearly dying during his transformation, he revived to find the blood of dragons empowering his body. Draven is reckless and driven by rage, pushing himself to his limits in combat. He tears down his enemies' hopes and defenses, leaving them vulnerable and afraid before they die.

### Vivienn Dirroze

Raised by frivolous nobles in a cutthroat court, [Vivienn Dirroze](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/vivienn-dirroze-fleemortals.md) decided young that her ambitions pointed higher. Her peers were content to vie for political power and assassinate rivals, but Vivienn refused to rest until she beheaded the source of true power—the gods themselves.

Filled with unholy ardor, the young human searched the world for secrets of god-killing. Finding traces of [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md), she made her way to the forgotten temple, where she offered her greataxe to the Hallowed Dark in exchange for the privilege of slaughtering the gods during the death of the world. [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) accepted her terms—and it was only then that Vivienn first heard the dragon's whispers.

Vivienn doesn't want power, she wants conquest. She yearns to meet her match and surpass it. [Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md)'s gifts allow the warrior to unleash a draconic bloodfrenzy. She gleefully toes the line between discipline and wildness, holiness and blasphemy, cutting down any who stand between her and the darkness.

[Qazyldrath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/qazyldrath-fleemortals.md) entrusted Aronar and Athmia with two rings: Aronar with the [Sun Eater's soul](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/sun-eaters-soul-fleemortals.md) and Athmia with the [Sun Eater's mind](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/sun-eaters-mind-fleemortals.md).

### Hallowed Dark Villain Actions

The Hallowed Dark has five villain party actions. The party can take each action once during an encounter after an enemy's turn. The party can take these actions in any order but can use only one per round. An action can be taken only if the creature performing it is present in the encounter and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

- **Action 1 Shadow Blessing.** Aronar chooses up to three members of the Hallowed Dark he can see within 120 feet of him. Each target can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space they can see, and until the end of each target's next turn, they are covered in shadowy armor that grants them resistance to all damage and a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  
- **Action 2 Dual Blades.** Athmia moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks and makes two melee attacks.  
- **Action 3 Hunter of Mortals.** Caithas imbues several arrows with draconic power. He can make one Scaled Longbow attack against each enemy within 600 feet of him. If any of these attacks reduces a target to 0 hit points, they die.  
- **Action 4 Blood Drain.** Draven steals the vitality of one enemy he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 27 (`5d10`) necrotic damage and is [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed) until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed). Draven then restores a number of hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage dealt, divided however he chooses between himself and any member of the Hallowed Dark he can see within 60 feet of him.  
- **Action 5 Wrath of the Godslayer.** Vivienn hurls her axe in a wrathful circle then compels it back into her hand. Each enemy within 30 feet of her must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 34 (`4d12 + 8`) slashing damage and be knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
