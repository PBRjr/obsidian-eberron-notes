# Introduction
*Source: Flee, Mortals!, p. 1* 

Good news! If you've run fifth edition, then you already understand how to use most of the creatures in this book. You may see a few unfamiliar details, but fear not: this introduction covers everything that's new, and the tweaks we made to creature stat blocks don't take much time at all to grok.

Beyond this introduction, this book is organized into four chapters:

**"Chapter 1: Creatures".** The bulk of this book contains the MCDM version of classic fantasy creatures like griffons and goblins, along with new creatures of our own design, like mournlings and valok.

**"Chapter 2: Environments".** The eight environments in this book present even more creatures! These are found in specific adventuring environments, like ruined keeps and sewers. Most environments also suggest traits and lair actions you can add to existing creatures.

**"Chapter 3: Villain Parties".** Challenge the player characters with a party of your own! Each of the seven villain parties has five NPCs with their own stories and unique stat blocks.

**"Chapter 4: New Psionic Powers".** If a player in your game has a talent character who uses the rules in *The Talent and Psionics* from MCDM, they can learn new powers from the psionic creatures in this book. You can find out more about *The Talent and Psionics* at mcdm.gg/talent.

## New Rules and Styles

The creatures in this book generally follow the core rules, but we've made a few tweaks. These new rules and presentation styles are designed to make combat encounters easier to run, more fun, and more memorable.

### Allies and Enemies

The effects in this book sometimes target just allies or enemies. A creature is your **ally** if they're inclined to help you or fight alongside you—or if you believe they're inclined to do so. However, you are not your own ally, so if you target your allies with an effect, it doesn't affect you. A creature is your **enemy** if they're inclined to oppose you or fight against you—or if you either believe they're inclined to do so, or you plan to pick a fight with them regardless. If in doubt, it's up to the GM to decide whether a creature counts as an ally, an enemy, or neither.

### Challenge Rating

Each creature's stat block lists their challenge rating in the top right corner. The more obvious placement of the challenge rating makes it easier to find stat blocks and build encounters to challenge your players.

### Conditions

Some of the creatures in this book inflict—or are immune to—the following new conditions.

[Dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed)

[Flanked](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Flanked)

### Creature Roles

Each creature has a role listed next to their challenge rating. Roles are descriptive and most don't follow special rules—they simply help you build encounters and use the creature effectively in combat.

#### Ambusher

Ambushers are creatures who hide well—not just before an encounter, but during it. They utilize surprise and stealth to gain the upper hand.

#### Artillery

Artillery creatures fight best from afar. Whether they wield arrows or magical rays, these creatures always try to keep a distance from their foes.

#### Brute

Brutes are hardy creatures who have lots of hit points and deal lots of damage. They might not be the most disciplined warriors, but they make up for it with sheer toughness and aggression.

#### Companion

Companion creatures are meant to accompany player characters on adventures. For more information, see the "Companion Creatures" section.

#### Controller

Controllers debuff, move, and obstruct their enemies. They often have crowd-control actions that apply a debilitating effect or target multiple creatures at once.

#### Leader

A leader is an action-oriented creature who fights alongside underlings. For more information, see the "Action-Oriented Creatures" section.

#### Minion

Minions are weak creatures who find strength in numbers. For more information, see the "Minions" section.

#### Retainer

Retainers are sapient beings meant to accompany player characters on adventures. For more information, see the "Retainers" section.

#### Skirmisher

Skirmishers are mobile warriors who use hit-and-run tactics in combat. Their traits allow them to make the most of their position.

#### Soldier

Soldiers are well-armored creatures who draw the attacks of their foes, freeing allies to move around the battlefield. These trained warriors typically have higher attack bonuses and AC.

#### Solo

A solo creature is an action-oriented creature who can take on the player characters on their own. For more information, see the "Action-Oriented Creatures" section.

#### Support

Support creatures aid their allies, providing buffs, healing, movement, or action options.

### Mundane and Supernatural

This book uses the term **mundane** to refer to attacks, items, and other effects that aren't magical or psionic.

On the other hand, the term **supernatural** describes an effect or item that is either magical or psionic. For instance, a creature's stat block might say they're resistant to "bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from mundane attacks." This means that when you deal them bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage using a spell, power, magic weapon, or psionic weapon, the damage is supernatural and thus the creature isn't resistant to it.

### Pronouns

The core rules often use the singular pronoun "it" to refer to a single creature. This book instead uses the singular "they" to clearly delineate between creatures and objects. Objects still use "it" as a singular pronoun.

### Psionic Powers

Some creatures have psionic powers, creating effects with sheer force of will instead of with magic. When a creature manifests a power, they create an effect that has similar rules to casting spells, with the following exceptions.

#### Not Magic

Powers don't create magical effects, so they're unaffected by features and spells like [antimagic field](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/antimagic-field-xphb.md), [counterspell](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/counterspell-xphb.md), and [dispel magic](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/dispel-magic-xphb.md). The damage from a power attack isn't magical. If a rule affects only spells or magical effects, it doesn't affect powers. However, psionic powers are supernatural, so if a rule affects supernatural effects, it does affect powers (see "Mundane and Supernatural").

#### Power Orders

Every power has an **order** that is an expression of its level of strength. Powers of the 1st order are the weakest (equivalent to cantrips in strength), and 6th-order powers are the strongest.

If a stat block feature should be considered a power, its order is noted in parentheses.

#### No Components

Powers don't have material, somatic, or verbal components.

#### Manifesting Multiple Powers

Unlike player characters, if a creature's stat block allows them to manifest a power as a bonus action, they can still manifest another power of 2nd order or higher as an action on that turn. For example, a creature who manifests the jaunt power as a bonus action can also make a 2nd-order power attack as an action. Similarly, many Multiattack actions let a creature make multiple power attacks on a turn, even though each attack is a power of its own.

#### Power Attacks as Opportunity Attacks

When an enemy's movement provokes an opportunity attack from a creature whose stat block includes a melee power attack, the creature can use their reaction to make a melee power attack against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.

#### New Powers

A character playing a talent—the class found in the MCDM supplement The Talent and Psionics (https://mcdm.gg/talent)—can use the rules in that book to learn new powers from the creatures in *Flee, Mortals!* Powers that aren't in *The Talent and Psionics* are indicated in a creature's stat block with an asterisk (*) and provided in the "New Psionic Powers" chapter of this book.

> [!note]
> Converter's Note: I left these asterisks out because they were ugly and, in the contexts in which this will be used, unnecessary.

### Save Ends Effects

Some creatures have a trait or action that, on a failed saving throw, imposes a debilitating effect for an extended duration. But sometimes a lucky foe can retry their saving throw and potentially end the effect early. In such situations, the stat block specifies "save ends at start of turn" or "save ends at end of turn."

When you see this phrase, it means any creature affected by a **save ends effect** like this can repeat the saving throw on each of their turns, ending the effect on themself early on a success. They can only make that saving throw either at the start or end of their turn, as specified in the stat block.

Here is an example of an attack with a save ends effect from the [goblin cursespitter](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/goblin-cursespitter-fleemortals.md) stat block:

**Toxic Touch (Cantrip).** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`2d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).

> [!note] Behind the Design: Save Ends Effects
> 
> Save ends effects are one way of saving space in stat blocks and making them less complex for GMs to run at the table. Much like how stat blocks just reference the poisoned condition instead of spelling its rules out each time, we didn't want to fill up the pages by repeating long sentences similar to this one: "A target poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on themself on a success."
^behind-the-design-save-ends-effects

### Spells

Some creatures have magical actions, bonus actions, and reactions. When these features should be considered spells (for the purpose of [counterspell](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/counterspell-xphb.md), [dispel magic](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/dispel-magic-xphb.md), and similar effects), the spell level is noted in parentheses. If the spell requires concentration, this is also noted in parentheses. Unless otherwise noted, these spells have somatic and verbal components.

#### Casting Multiple Spells

Unlike player characters, if a creature's stat block allows them to cast a spell as a bonus action, they can still cast another spell of 1st level or higher as an action on that turn. For example, a creature who casts the [misty step](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/misty-step-xphb.md) spell as a bonus action can also make a 2nd-level spell attack as an action. Similarly, many Multiattack actions let a creature make multiple spell attacks on a turn, even though each attack is a spell of its own.

#### Spell Attacks as Opportunity Attacks

When an enemy's movement provokes an opportunity attack from a creature whose stat block includes a melee spell attack, the creature can use their reaction to make a melee spell attack against the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack.

#### Utility Spells

In addition to combat-focused spells, some creatures can cast spells that are primarily used outside of combat. To streamline the stat blocks, these spells aren't written out in the creature's combat-oriented "Actions" section. Instead, their names are listed in a separate "Utility Spells" section at the end of the stat block. After each spell name, the casting time is indicated in superscript, as shown in the Casting Times table.

> [!note]
> Note that at least for the moment, there is no "Utility Spells" section in these blocks on this site. The casting times superscripts are included, however.

#### Casting Times

| Superscript | Casting Time |  |
|-------------|--------------|--|
| A | 1 action |
| B | 1 bonus action |
| R | 1 reaction |
| + | Longer than 1 action (see spell description) |
^superscript-casting-time

For example, a spellcaster's utility spells might appear as follows:

1/day each: expeditious retreat<sup>B</sup>, mage armor<sup>A</sup>, phantom steed<sup>+</sup>

### Section Structure

In this book, creature sections begin with broad descriptions for all the creatures in that section. While not all the information is common in-character knowledge, you can share these early pages with your players if you don't mind them having a little meta-knowledge.

The creature stat blocks aren't presented until the end of each section, allowing you to share flavorful information with your players and flip fewer pages when you run a band of similar creatures.

### Unusual Needs

Stat blocks in the core rules often indicate when a creature has an unusual nature and doesn't require air, food, sleep, or water to live and function. To keep the stat blocks in this book succinct, we've omitted those traits from individual stat blocks. Instead, you can refer to the following list to determine each creature type's unusual needs (or lack thereof):

- **Construct.** Constructs don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.  
- **Elemental.** Elementals don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.  
- **Ooze.** Oozes don't require air or sleep.  
- **Undead.** Undead don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.  
- **Other Creature Types.** Unless otherwise specified, other creature types require air, food, drink, and sleep.  

## Action-Oriented Creatures

The solo and leader creatures presented in this book are designed to be bosses: enemies who can take on an entire party by themselves or with a handful of underlings. Rather than simply increasing the challenge rating (an approach that often leads to underwhelming encounters), this book introduces **action-oriented creatures.**

A powerful villain needs plenty of opportunities to act and move when it's not their turn. Thus, each actionoriented creature has at least one special bonus action and reaction, as well as a special section with villain actions that let them dominate the battlefield.

These actions make the boss creatures dynamic and formidable. Whether fought as an exciting solo challenge or alongside a few easy-to-run underlings, action-oriented creatures challenge the characters with dramatic and powerful actions in combat.

### Villain Actions

Every action-oriented creature has three **villain actions** they can use after an enemy's turn. Villain actions are similar to legendary actions with the following exceptions:

- A creature can use only one villain action per round (as such, villain actions tend to be more powerful than legendary actions).  
- Each villain action can only be used once during a combat encounter.  

Like legendary actions, a creature can't use villain actions if incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions.

#### Choosing Villain Actions

Each trio of villain actions has a recommended round order. These abilities give the battle a logical flow and a cinematic arc:

- The first villain action is an opener, which shows the characters they're not battling a typical creature. Openers generally deal some damage, summon a lackey or three, buff the boss, debuff the characters, or move the creature into an advantageous position. They're just a taste of what's to come.  
- The second villain action provides crowd control. It typically fires after the heroes have had a chance to respond once or twice, get into position, and surround the villain. This second action helps the villain regain the upper hand. Like an opener, this action comes in many flavors, but it's even more powerful than an opener.  
- The third and final villain action is an ultimate move or "ult"—a showstopper the villain can use to deal a devastating blow to the characters before the end of the battle.  

While every creature has a recommended order of actions, you can take villain actions in any order if it makes your fight more dramatic. You could push back a villain action if a creature is stunned or might stay alive for more than three rounds, or you could perform the recommended third action in round two after several surprise critical hits!

### Unique Creatures

Many of the action-oriented creatures in this book are unique. They typically have a specific name and backstory, though you can ignore these if you wish to use the creature's stat block in another way in your campaign. For instance, [Queen Bargnot](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/queen-bargnot-fleemortals.md)'s stat block could be used for any action-oriented goblin in your game.

## Companion Creatures

A **companion** is a wild ally who adventures with characters. Each companion has unique traits and actions that make them a great ally. But beware! These creatures can be difficult to control in the heat of battle and just might bite the hand that feeds. Don't fret too much, though! A companion gelatinous cube or owlbear is worth the risk of an occasional wild rampage.

### Caregiver

Every companion has a player character **caregiver** who commands the creature. The caregiver's player controls the companion most of the time during the game, though the GM can step in to take control if the companion and caregiver are separated, or if the caregiver mistreats the companion in some way.

In combat, a companion shares a turn with their caregiver and acts during the caregiver's turn. A companion can move and use their own reaction and bonus action independently. But they can take only the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions unless their caregiver uses a bonus action to command the companion to take a different action, including any of the actions noted in the companion's stat block. A companion must be able to see or hear their caregiver to receive a command. A companion can also take other actions if their caregiver is incapacitated or if the companion enters a rampage (as discussed below).

> [!note] One Companion Per Group
> 
> Companions are a lot of fun, but having more than one companion to manage can slow things down at the table. A companion is another member of the party, with statistics and actions to track, and additional companions can easily make combat slow to a crawl. If every player wants to get in on the companion action, it's simpler for the characters to take turns as a creature's caregiver, rather than running around adventuring with a menagerie.
> 
> For characters wishing to share a companion, the companion accepts a new caregiver at the end of a short or long rest. Because a companion's proficiency bonus and hit points depend on their caregiver's level, those statistics might fluctuate if the characters in a party are different levels, reflecting that a more experienced caregiver is more adept at directing a companion.
^one-companion-per-group

#### Charmed Caregiver

A caregiver who is charmed can still command their companion, but they can't command the companion to attack a creature who charmed them.

#### Incapacitated or Absent Caregiver

If a companion's caregiver is incapacitated or dies, the GM determines who controls the companion—typically, the caregiver's player can maintain control of their companion as they take a heroic stand against the enemy.

However, in cases where a caregiver and their companion are physically separated, such as when a companion is captured, the GM might wish to take control of the companion to keep the player in suspense about the creature's fate.

#### New Caregiver

At the GM's discretion, a companion can abandon a caregiver character and choose a different willing creature as a caregiver.

### Ferocity

Companions are dangerous creatures. Though often more docile than their wild counterparts, they aren't fully domesticated. Each companion's **ferocity** is a measure of their tenacity and fury, and of how those things build in battle. As a companion's ferocity increases, they gain access to powerful new actions, but they also become more difficult for a caregiver to control.

If a companion isn't incapacitated at the start of their and their caregiver's turn, their ferocity increases by `1d4` + the number of enemies the companion can see or hear within 5 feet of them. For the purpose of increasing ferocity, a group of creatures who share a single stat block (such as a swarm of rats) counts as one creature. Ferocity increases round after round during combat, and there is no maximum to the level of ferocity a companion can gain.

> [!note] Bag of Rats
> 
> We can already tell that some crafty players are scheming to stuff a bag full of slightly groggy rats, then open that bag up in front of their companion to build up their ferocity during a fight. However, a too-easy target doesn't rile up a companion the way being threatened by an enemy combatant in a battle for survival does. As such, the GM makes the final decision as to what constitutes an enemy for the purpose of increasing a companion's ferocity. Likewise, in the same way a swarm of creatures is counted as a single creature for the purpose of increasing ferocity, the GM is free to determine that two or three weak creatures might count as only one creature for that purpose.
^bag-of-rats

#### Rampage

After rolling to increase ferocity at the start of their turn, if a companion has 10 ferocity or more and isn't incapacitated, they run the risk of entering a **rampage**. The companion's caregiver can make a Wisdom ([Animal Handling](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check (no action required) to try to stop the companion from entering a rampage. To make the check, the caregiver must not be incapacitated, and the companion must be able to see or hear the caregiver. The DC for the check equals 5 + the companion's ferocity. On a success, the companion acts normally on their turn. On a failure, or if the caregiver doesn't make the check, the companion enters a rampage.

When a companion enters a rampage, they immediately move up to their speed toward the nearest creature they can sense and attack that creature with their signature attack (see below), dealing extra damage equal to half their ferocity if the attack hits. If at least one ally and one enemy are nearest and equidistant to the companion, the caregiver's player rolls any die. On an odd number, the companion attacks an ally. On an even number, the companion attacks an enemy. The caregiver's player determines which specific equidistant ally or enemy the companion engages (and can choose their own character if they wish).

A companion who can't reach a creature to attack while in a rampage uses the Dash action to move as far as they can toward the nearest creature they can sense. If a companion can't sense any potential targets, they move as far as they can in a random direction determined by the GM, avoiding danger.

When a companion who has entered a rampage resolves their action or ends their turn, their ferocity drops to 0 and they're no longer in a rampage.

#### Reducing Ferocity

To prevent a companion from entering a dangerous rampage, a caregiver has several options at their disposal for reducing the creature's ferocity.

##### Ferocity Actions

Each companion has three actions in their stat block that cost ferocity to use. To use one of these ferocity actions, the caregiver's character level must be equal to or greater than the ferocity action's level, and the companion must spend the necessary amount of ferocity before they use the action. If the companion doesn't have enough ferocity to spend, they can't use the action.

Ferocity actions always use the companion's action, meaning they can't be used as part of an opportunity attack. Ferocity actions can't be used while a companion is in a rampage.

##### End of Combat

When a combat encounter involving a companion ends and the companion isn't dying, the companion regains hit points equal to their ferocity, and their ferocity drops to 0. The GM determines when a combat encounter ends, typically at the point when creatures stop acting in initiative order.

### Dying Companions

When a companion is reduced to 0 hit points, they are dying and make death saving throws just as characters do. Thus, characters always have a chance to save their furry (or scaly, or slimy, or exoskeletony) friends' lives! If combat ends while a companion is dying, their ferocity drops to 0 but they don't regain hit points (see "End of Combat" above).

### Statistics

In addition to their ferocity actions, a companion's statistics vary from the statistics of their wild counterparts. This makes a companion easier to run, keeps their power in line with other companions, and helps ensure companions never outshine the characters. As somewhat more social versions of wild creatures, companions are often cleverer and more versatile than their untamed counterparts.

#### Hit Dice

Most creatures without character classes have their Hit Die type determined by their size (d4 for Tiny creatures, d6 for Small creatures, and so forth). However, companions are special and use a d8 for Hit Dice regardless of size.

#### Language

A companion shares a unique bond with their caregiver and can understand basic commands in one language chosen by the caregiver. However, the companion can't read, speak, or write any language, even if similar creatures normally can.

#### Proficiency Bonus

Because a companion's effectiveness and survivability depend on the training and expertise of their caregiver, a companion's proficiency bonus is equal to their caregiver's proficiency bonus. Additionally, some of a companion's statistics refer to their proficiency bonus, abbreviated as PB. Other statistics use a number of dice equal to a companion's proficiency bonus; these are expressed with PB in place of the number of dice. For example, if a companion has a +2 proficiency bonus, PBd6 means 2d6.

#### Signature Attack

Each companion has an action designated as their signature attack. A signature attack is always a melee attack, and it's typically the creature's best natural attack. A companion uses their signature attack when they enter a rampage.

Each companion also has special actions that they can use only by spending ferocity during their turn, with some of those actions making use of the companion's signature attack. See "Reducing Ferocity" above for more information on ferocity actions.

### Companion Mounts

Many companions are large enough to ride, especially by caregivers who are Small, when outfitted with an exotic saddle similar to those worn by aquatic or flying mounts. When a caregiver rides a companion into combat, not much actually changes. The caregiver and companion still each act on the same turn, and the caregiver must use their bonus action to direct the companion to take any action other than the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Under some circumstances, a companion might allow themself to be ridden by a creature other than their caregiver, though that other creature can't give the companion commands.

If a companion rampages while bearing a rider, that rider counts as being within 5 feet of the companion when determining which creature the companion attacks. If a companion attacks their rider, they have disadvantage on the attack roll.

> [!note] Companion Barding
> 
> At the GM's discretion, characters can purchase barding for a companion, as discussed in the core rules, with the following adjustments:
> 
> - Barding for Small companions weighs half as much as the equivalent armor for Humanoids. Barding for Medium companions weighs the same as Humanoid armor, while barding for Large companions weighs four times as much.  
> - Companions are proficient in any barding they wear.  
> - When a companion wears barding, they don't add their caregiver's proficiency bonus to their AC.  
> - Companions who are shapechangers (such as the mimic companion) can't use that ability while wearing barding.  
> - Companions who have corrosive bodies or are amorphous (such as the gelatinous cube companion) can't wear nonmagical barding.  
^companion-barding

### Companion Encounter Balance

Unless a caregiver has the beastheart class (found in Beastheart and Monstrous Companions (https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/beastheart-companions)), the GM should consider a companion as akin to a powerful combat-focused magic item when building encounters. A companion gives a party a significant power boost, not just by dishing out more damage and providing more hit points for enemies to target, but also by creating complications that can make a fight more challenging for the party's foes. GMs can adjust encounter difficulty by one step (from easy to medium, hard to deadly, and so forth) to properly challenge a group of characters with a companion, particularly if the characters' average level is 7th or lower.

### NPCs with Companions

Companion creatures are designed to accompany player characters on adventures. If an NPC has a pet or creature servant, it's recommended you use the creature's normal stat block. For instance, if an NPC ranger has an owlbear they work with, that creature would use the normal [owlbear](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear.md) stat block and be played by the GM as normal. But if the characters are charged with rescuing a fallen druid NPC's owlbear pet from the clutches of a villain, the GM can choose to instead make the pet an [owlbear companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear-companion-fleemortals.md), allowing the creature to join their rescuers on their adventures.

## Retainers

**Retainers** are sapient beings who adventure alongside the player characters. Each retainer is a less experienced adventurer who a player character can take under their wing. Retainers are never meant to achieve the same power level as the player characters.

Rules for retainers first appeared in "Strongholds & Followers". This book contains updated rules for these followers.

### Mentor

Every retainer has a player character **mentor**. A retainer's mentor gives them orders, and the mentor's player also controls the retainer. A retainer acts on the same initiative count as their mentor in combat, acting immediately before or after the mentor (player's choice). As a mentor gains experience and levels up, so does their retainer (see "Statistics" below).

### Statistics

Retainers are designed to be easy to run so their player (who is already managing a complex character) doesn't get overwhelmed with even more details. Each retainer has a simple stat block—though these are similar to other creature stat blocks, retainers follow a few different rules.

#### Level

A retainer's level equals their mentor's level. As a retainer levels up, their hit points increase (see "Hit Points and Hit Dice") and they gain combat features (see "Features"). Additionally, a few of their statistics increase when their mentor's proficiency bonus does, including attack bonuses, skills, and save DC (see "Proficiency Bonus"). Their other statistics typically remain the same regardless of their level.

#### Armor Class

Unlike player characters, a retainer's armor class isn't determined by a particular set of armor they don (like studded leather). Instead, each retainer's armor class is simplified to one of three armor types:

- Retainers with light armor have AC 13.  
- Retainers with medium armor have AC 15.  
- Retainers with heavy armor have AC 18.  

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

Retainers gain one Hit Die per level. Their hit point maximum is based on the size of their Hit Die, as shown on the Retainer Hit Points table.

Retainers have exceptionally high hit points—sometimes even higher than their mentor. This allows the party to enjoy the presence of a beloved retainer without worrying about losing them to an unlucky roll of the dice or decision by a single player. The GM often awards characters with retainers in lieu of other treasure. Such rewards shouldn't be lost easily.

**Retainer Hit Points**

| Hit Die Size | Hit Point Maximum |  |
|--------------|-------------------|--|
| d6 | 6 times their level |
| d8 | 7 times their level |
| d10 | 8 times their level |
| d12 | 9 times their level |
^retainer-hit-points

#### Proficiency Bonus

Because a retainer's effectiveness and survivability depend on the training and expertise of their mentor, a retainer's proficiency bonus is equal to their mentor's proficiency bonus.

Some of a retainer's statistics refer to their proficiency bonus, abbreviated as PB. Other statistics use a number of dice equal to a retainer's proficiency bonus; these are expressed with PB in place of the number of dice. For example, if a retainer has a +3 proficiency bonus, `PBd10` means `3d10`.

A retainer adds their proficiency bonus to any saving throw they make.

#### Features

Each retainer has a **signature attack** they can make using the Attack action each round. Retainers can use their signature attack to make opportunity attacks, even if their signature attack isn't a melee weapon attack.

A retainer gains new features at 3rd, 5th, and 7th level. Some features can only be used a certain number of times per day (as noted in the retainer's stat block).

Additionally, if a retainer's signature attack is a weapon attack, they typically gain an extra attack at 7th level (as noted in their stat block), allowing them to make two signature attacks per round instead of one.

#### Gear

When a retainer joins the party, they typically carry clothes appropriate to their position, a suit of armor, a weapon, and an explorer's pack. If the retainer casts spells, they also carry a spellcasting implement. Any additional equipment must be provided to them by their mentor.

***Magic Items.*** Retainers can use magic items like anyone else. For example, a [+1 weapon](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/1-weapon-xdmg.md) increases their attack and damage rolls by 1, and [+1 armor](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/1-armor-xdmg.md) of the appropriate type (light, medium, or heavy) increases their AC by 1.

One happy side effect of having retainers is that as a player character levels up and acquires better equipment, they can pass their obsolete items on to the retainer.

### Dying Retainers

When a retainer is reduced to 0 hit points, they follow the same rules as player characters. If not killed instantly by massive damage, they fall unconscious, make death saving throws, and can be stabilized or healed.

### Optional Rules: Shared Attacks

If a player wants to speed up their retainer's turn, they can make **shared attacks** at the GM's discretion.

When the mentor hits a creature with an attack, if their retainer can see or hear them, the retainer is inspired by their mentor's success. On the inspired retainer's next turn, for each successful attack their mentor just made, the retainer can automatically hit a creature of their choice within range with their signature attack, up to the number of attacks the retainer can make.

If the mentor hit with fewer attacks than the numberof attacks the retainer can make, the retainer can make  additional attack rolls for those attacks to see if they hit.

### Retainer Encounter Balance

When building encounters, the GM should consider a retainer as akin to a powerful combat-focused magic item. A retainer gives a party a significant power boost; they not only dish out more damage and provide more hit points for enemies to target, but they also create complications to challenge the party's foes. GMs can increase encounter difficulty by one step (from easy to medium, hard to deadly, and so forth) to properly challenge a group of characters with a retainer.

## Minions

A **minion** is a weak foe, designed to allow GMs to create dramatic combat encounters with hordes of enemies without overwhelming the characters. In fact, an encounter with minions makes characters feel heroic, since they can take on a myriad of foes and live to tell the tale.

However, minions still make threatening foes. Killing a minion still requires penetrating their defenses, and characters can't just shrug off damage from minion attacks.

So how do minions make running a horde of enemies quick and easy for the GM?

- Minions are simple to run. Their stat blocks are small and uncomplicated.  
- Minions act quickly. They don't multiattack, roll for damage, or take unique bonus actions or reactions, so their turns aren't long.  
- Minions die fast. A character can kill several minions with a single weapon attack!  
- Minions have strength in numbers. Their attacks can be grouped together to make them deadlier and faster to use at the table.  

### No Hit Dice

Minions have hit points but no Hit Dice, simplifying their design. Minions can't spend Hit Dice to heal during a short rest because they have none.

### No Damage Rolls

Minions don't roll for damage because their attacks deal a static amount of damage. They also can't score critical hits.

### Shared Turns

Typically, all minions of the same stat block act on the same turn. Since they share a turn, the minions can each move into position then each use an action if they wish, instead of each moving and taking an action individually.

### Minion Trait

Every minion has the Minion trait, which affects the creature in the following ways:

- If the minion takes any damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, their hit points are reduced to 0.  
- If the minion takes damage from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum; otherwise they take no damage.  

### Overkill Attacks

Powerful weapon attacks can kill more than one minion in a single maneuver called an **overkill attack.**

As already discussed, a weapon attack requires only 1 point of damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, regardless of their hit point maximum. However, when a weapon attack's damage does exceed the target minion's hit point maximum, the attack becomes an overkill attack and the damage dealt beyond the minion's hit point maximum becomes **overkill damage.**

Overkill damage can be applied to a second minion who has the same stat block as the target and is in overkill range (see below). Damage against the second minion is counted as if you made a weapon attack against them; since it only takes 1 point of weapon damage to reduce a minion to 0 hit points, any amount of overkill damage immediately knocks them out. But wait, it gets better—if the initial attack's overkill damage exceeds the second minion's hit point maximum, the leftover overkill damage can roll over to a third minion, and so on! In other words, for each time the overkill damage exceeds the new target's hit point maximum, the attacker can choose an additional minion to reduce to 0 hit points.

For example, when a weapon attack deals 18 damage to a minion with a hit point maximum of 5, the overkill damage is 13. If there are three additional minions of the same stat block in overkill range, they can all three be immediately reduced to 0 hit points, since the overkill damage exceeded the target's hit point maximum more than twice over.

Overkill attacks can't be made as part of an opportunity attack.

### Overkill Range

Minions must be within a certain range to qualify for an overkill attack, determined by whether the attack is a melee or ranged attack. In addition to the examples below, the "Overkill Damage Illustrated" sidebar demonstrates how to calculate overkill damage.

#### Melee Overkill Attacks

When a creature hits a minion with a melee weapon attack, other minions within reach of the attack are in **overkill range** and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can't target minions outside the weapon attack's reach.

*Lady Ulnock the paladin battles a horde of goblin minions (each with 6 hit points). She hits a goblin minion with her longsword and uses Divine Smite, dealing 8 slashing damage and 11 radiant damage to the target for a total of 19 damage. Since Lady Ulnock dealt 13 points of overkill damage—more than the hit point maximum of two additional minions—she can choose up to three additional goblin minions within 5 feet of her (the reach of her longsword attack) and reduce them to 0 hit points. If there are no other goblin minions within 5 feet of Lady Ulnock, she can't damage additional minions with this attack.*

#### Ranged Overkill Attacks

When a creature hits a minion with a ranged weapon attack, other minions in a line originating from the creature in the direction of the target, to a distance equal to the weapon's short range, are in **overkill range** and can be chosen as additional targets for an overkill attack. The overkill attack can't target minions outside the line or beyond the weapon's short range.

*Perigold Quickfingers the rogue is hidden and takes aim at a group of zombie minions (each with 6 hit points) with his light crossbow (which has a short range of 80 feet). He hits a zombie minion with his crossbow, dealing extra damage thanks to his Sneak Attack, for a total of 14 damage. Since Perigold dealt 8 points of overkill damage—more than the hit point maximum of one additional minion—he can choose up to two additional zombie minions in an 80-foot-long line extending from Perigold in the direction of the target, reducing them to 0 hit points. If there are no other zombie minions in the line, then Perigold can't damage other minions with this attack.*

> [!note] Behind the Design: Minion Trait
> 
> You might ask, why not just give minions 1 hit point and take no damage when they save for half, like in fourth edition? First, spells that use a creature's hit points to determine effectiveness—like [color spray](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/color-spray-xphb.md) and [sleep](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/sleep-xphb.md)—would devastate all minions, even those meant to challenge high-level characters. These spells are still effective againstminions, just not devastating!
> 
> Second, spells and effects that deal damage without any attack roll or save—like [magic missile](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/magic-missile-xphb.md) and [spike growth](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/spike-growth-xphb.md)—would lay waste to minions with 1 hit point. This fits the fiction for minions with low challenge ratings, like goblins and zombies. But the balance of combat and fiction breaks down to near-silliness at higher levels when the same spells easily take down powerful devil minions.
> 
> Finally, high-level spells with a save for half damage—like [fireball](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/fireball-xphb.md) or [meteor swarm](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/meteor-swarm-xphb.md)—would feel wasted against minions with 1 hit point. Why use a higher-level spell when a lower-level one will do? Similarly, the fourth edition design could lead to a kobold minion illogically surviving a fireball spell while a "stronger" standard kobold next to them dies, despite both creatures succeeding on their saving throw. By contrast, under this book's minion rules, spellcasters still have a good reason to use high-level spells against minions.

> [!note] Overkill Damage Illustrated
> 
> Imagine a fighter is making a melee attack with a shortsword against a lackey, and two more lackeys are within overkill range of that attack. Each lackey is a minion with 6 hit points. In example A, the attack hits and deals 4 piercing damage. This kills only the targeted lackey. A successful attack against a minion always kills the target.
> 
> In example B, the attack is a critical hit and deals 13 piercing damage. This kills the targeted lackey with 7 overkill damage remaining, which spreads to the other minions within the fighter's overkill range. So a second lackey within 5 feet of the fighter takes 6 piercing damage and dies, leaving 1 overkill damage remaining. The third lackey takes that last point of overkill damage and dies.

^overkill-damage-illustrated

### Group Attacks

Each minion has at least one group attack action that speeds up play. In a group attack, two to five minions of the same stat block who share a turn can all use their action to join the attack, provided the target is within the original attack's reach or range for each minion.

- Make a single attack roll for the group attack. It counts as one attack.  
- A group attack roll gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for each minion who joins the attack. (For example, if four goblin minions make a group attack together, the attack roll has a +4 bonus.)  
- If the group attack hits, multiply the damage by the number of minions who joined that group attack. (For example, if four goblin minions hit with a group attack that deals `1` damage, their group attack deals `4` damage.)  

The GM decides how many minions join a group attack. For instance, if five minions surround a target, the GM may decide to have all five attack at once to speed up combat, or may break up the attacks among smaller groups to increase the odds that some minions hit while others miss. A single minion can even use their group attack action on their own—they make the attack as a normal creature would, and simply don't benefit from the group bonuses described above.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage

A group attack is only made with advantage or disadvantage if all the minions joining the group attack have advantage or disadvantage on the attack roll. Otherwise, the attack is made without advantage or disadvantage.

#### Cover and Concealment

If a target has cover or concealment from some but not all minions, the GM should divide the minions into multiple groups based on the type of cover or concealment they have, then make a separate attack for each group.

#### Target Response Effects

If a group attack triggers a reaction or similar effect that would normally affect a single attacker, such as the [fire shield](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/fire-shield-xphb.md) or [hellish rebuke](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/hellish-rebuke-xphb.md) spell, the target of the group attack picks one minion who joined the attack to be affected by the effect.

#### Group Opportunity Attacks

If a creature provokes an opportunity attack from more than one minion of the same stat block at a time and those minions have a melee group attack action, the minions can each use their reaction to join a group attack as an opportunity attack.

### Optional Rule: Group Saving Throws

Though minions often make saving throws individually, there are times when rolling individual saving throws for each minion could slow down the fight, like when a cleric surrounded by eighteen shade minions uses Turn Undead.

When many minions with the same stat block need to make a saving throw against the same effect at the same time, you can make one saving throw for a group of up to five minions at a time. All minions in a group use the result of the saving throw.

For instance, if thirty-four goblin minions need to make a saving throw against a hypnotic pattern spell, the minions would make a total of seven saving throws against the spell: six for thirty minions divided into six groups of five, and one more save for the remaining group of four minions.

### Optional Rule: Tough Minions

Minions of a higher challenge rating, such as abyssal ghouls or fire giants, make for powerful foes. Consequently, it could break the game's verisimilitude for an NPC commoner to kill such a minion with a single attack. To keep minions believable, you can use the following rule.

When a minion's challenge rating is at least 6 higher than an NPC's challenge rating, that NPC's actions and traits affect a minion as if they didn't have the Minion trait, reducing the minion's hit points like a normal creature instead of automatically dropping them to 0.

This rule shouldn't be applied to player characters—they're heroes who can always kill a minion in one hit.

### Special Traits

Many minions have traits that give them strength in numbers but become less powerful as their allies are defeated. For example, an enemy who starts their turn within 5 feet of three or more goblin lackeys must succeed on a saving throw or take damage from the lackeys' Tiny Stabs trait.

### Challenge Ratings

Minions have a challenge rating just like any other creature. However, their experience point value depends on their challenge rating, as shown on the Minion Encounter Building table. Aside from their damage output, the Minion trait, and their experience point value, a minion's statistics are on par with a standard creature of the same challenge rating.

When the rules reference a challenge rating, such as the [polymorph](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/polymorph-xphb.md) spell or the cleric's Destroy Undead feature, use the minion's listed challenge rating as normal. For instance, a 5th-level cleric can affect Undead creatures with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower with their Destroy Undead feature—so this feature can affect rotting zombie minions (CR 1/4) but not shade minions (CR 1).

### Building Minion Encounters

Minions present opportunities for memorable, cinematic encounters. Keep the following tips in mind to achieve maximum fun while planning and running combat encounters with minions.

#### Encounter Difficulty

When building encounters against a single foe, the core rules advise matching the characters with a creature whose challenge rating (CR) is close to the average party level. What happens when you add minions to the mix?

You can use the Minion Encounter Building table to determine how many minions are equivalent to one standard creature of that CR for encounter building.

You can increase a minion's challenge rating using the rules in the "Modifying and Making Minions" section.

#### Tell Your Players

While it's tempting to pit your unsuspecting players against a horde of fire giants just to watch their eyes pop out of their faces in surprise, minion encounters are more fun overall if you share the rules for minions with your players before they get into an encounter. They'll understand how overkill and group attacks work, spend their resources more efficiently, and be able to help you track the fight more easily, which is worth a lot more than the shock value of a sea of foes the players don't know are minions.

If you want the best of both worlds, end a session with the characters confronting a horde of creatures before rolling initiative. At the start of the next session, reveal those creatures are minions and share the rules.

#### Not Too Many

When you're planning your encounters, think of five minions as one standard creature. While it might be exciting to throw a hundred minions at the characters, that's like them facing twenty standard creatures. It can be done and might even be fun, but it's not the typical minion experience and results in a much longer battle than normal. Keep the following tips in mind when adding minions to an encounter:

- When the characters are 10th level or lower, most encounters work well with ten to twenty minions in addition to other creatures.  
- When the characters are 11th level or higher, they're more efficient at killing minions, and many of the poor critters will die before even acting. Most high-level encounters work well with twenty to thirty minions.  
- If you find midbattle that minions are dying too quickly to present a challenge, you can have reinforcements join the fray.  
- Though too many minions can cause a problem, you don't want too few either. If you're using minions in your encounter, plan to include at least enough minions to count as one standard creature, as shown on the Minion Encounter Building table. You won't break anything if you include fewer—the encounter just isn't likely to be as satisfying.  

#### Add Standard Creatures

Minion encounters become more dynamic if you add some standard creatures allied with the minions. A hag coven surrounded by ogre minions or a red dragon tyrant commanding fire giant minions present more interesting encounters than copies of the same enemy, challenging the characters to use diverse tactics.

> [!note] Minion Bands
> 
> A combat encounter with more than five minions per character can become deadly if all minions act on the same turn—the characters cut down minion hordes on their turns but then suffer massive damage as a sea of minions pour down on them. While many groups like this challenge, you have the option to divide the minions into different bands that act on different initiative counts. If you do this, minions can only join group attacks with minions in the same band. At the start of a new round, two or more bands of minions can reorganize into one band, acting on the lowest initiative count of the bands that combined.
> 
> If you divide minions into bands, be sure to distinguish which minions belong together. For gridded combat, you could use a colored marker for each miniature. In a theater of the mind encounter, try group descriptors like "zombie dwarves" and "zombie elves."
^minion-bands

#### Cut the Choke Points

Since minions are most effective in numbers, avoid encounters in cramped dungeon tunnels and similar choke points. Combat becomes dull in tight quarters if only a couple minions can attack at a time.

### Modifying and Making Minions

You can increase a minion's challenge rating or create new minions using the Minion Statistics by Challenge Rating table. To change an existing minion's challenge rating, adjust their proficiency bonus, hit points, and damage dealt by their attacks. If a minion's proficiency bonus changes, their AC, ability modifiers, attack bonuses, and the DC for ability checks and saving throws made to resist the minion's traits and actions have the same adjustments. For example, if the minion's proficiency bonus increases by 1, so do their AC, ability modifiers, attack bonuses, and DCs.

If you're using the table to create a new minion, you can lift statistics directly from the table. If the minion doesn't wear armor and their AC is less than 10 plus their proficiency modifier, consider giving the creature natural armor that grants a bonus to AC equal to their proficiency bonus.

The table is merely a guide—feel free to tweak the math to get the specific minion you desire.

**Minion Statistics by Challenge Rating**

## The Timescape

The places, people, and other proper names in the lore of this book come from the timescape, the MCDM multiverse. Most of the creatures detailed in this book are found in Orden, a world of high fantasy and just one of the timescape's many planes (also called manifolds). Orden is also called the Mundane World. If you like what you're reading, you can find more lore about the timescape on the MCDM Patreon at mcdm.gg/patreon.

You can ignore any creature's lore if you wish to use their stat block in another way in your campaign.

## Using Creature Roles

Creature roles help you build interesting encounters with varied challenges. While including every role in a combat encounter makes the battle too complicated for most groups, a fight with creatures who are all the same role typically leads to dull, grindy combat—and few players (or GMs) enjoy combat where both sides are just standing still and rolling to hit without anything dynamic or dramatic happening. For instance, an encounter with a controller, a skirmisher, and two soldiers is more interesting and fun than an encounter with four soldiers.

### Ambusher Creatures

Ambusher creatures can hide, become invisible, or otherwise disappear from sight on their turns. They typically spend half their turn attacking a player character, and the other half slipping away and hiding. They focus on taking down a single character, sometimes dragging their target into the place where they hide.

Encounters that include ambushers should have plenty of cover, giving them places to hide. Adding other creatures—typically brutes, minions, skirmishers, or soldiers—keeps other player characters busy while the ambusher focuses on taking down a single target.

### Artillery Creatures

Artillery creatures are great at ranged combat and can damage player characters who typically hang back behind beefier counterparts. Most artillery creatures are weak in melee, so add some brutes, minions, or soldiers for them to hide behind during combat.

On their turn in combat, an artillery creature typically tries to move away from any foes within 30 feet, puts a brute, soldier, or other ally between themself and the threat, then attacks that enemy. If forced into melee, most artillery creatures do whatever they can to get away, including using the Dash or Disengage action. If no enemies are closing in, artillery creatures move to keep the player characters at the edge of their range and often attack the biggest threat to their allies first.

### Brute Creatures

Brute creatures hit hard and have a lot of hit points. Their damage output can't be ignored, so player characters often focus on taking down brutes instead of other creatures who have fewer hit points or are weaker in melee. Brutes need to get up close to perform their most devastating attacks, so they work best on smaller battlefields. On their turn in combat, brutes move toward the closest group of enemies and attack, preferring to engage multiple foes at once. Brutes tend to be simpler to run than other creatures, so you can include a lot of them in an encounter.

### Controller Creatures

With their ability to debuff, hamper, and move player characters, controllers make a dynamic addition to any battle. They tend to have more complicated actions and traits with unique effects, so most combat encounters shouldn't have more than one or two controllers.

Many controllers work best when they have brutes, minions, skirmishers, and soldiers protecting them and taking advantage of the effects they create. Controllers often use their biggest and most powerful effects at the start of an encounter, affecting as many foes as possible. If the controller can't affect multiple characters or use their most powerful feature, they focus on manipulating the battlefield and repositioning so they can use that feature on their next turn.

### Leader and Support Creatures

Leader creatures are action oriented (see "Action-Oriented Creatures") and fight best alongside allies. Support creatures function much like leaders, but they lack villain actions and are less complex.

Leader and support creatures can summon reinforcements, buff their allies, and grant allies extra movement and actions. As long as a leader or support creature stays in the fight, their allies are enhanced. They are most effective when protected by and buffing artillery, brutes, minions, skirmishers, and soldiers. You typically shouldn't use more than one leader or support creature in an encounter, as their overlapping enhancements can turn a seemingly normal encounter into a fatal one.

Leaders and support creatures remain close to their allies so their features can benefit as many creatures as possible.

### Minion Creatures

As discussed in the "Minions" section, minions allow you to create cinematic battles where the characters feel heroic as they cut through several foes at a time. Using minions of a challenge rating within 2 of the characters' average level also keeps them dangerous and relevant. When minions work together, they can't be ignored, as they deal a lot of damage and can lock down the characters. Minions make excellent protectors for ambushers, artillery, controllers, and leaders.

### Skirmisher Creatures

Skirmisher creatures make battles dynamic. They can move to attack vulnerable player characters who are weaker in melee, then retreat (if they can do so safely) to protect their artillery, controller, leader, and support allies. Since they can outrun and outmaneuver player characters, this forces the heroes to act tactically. Skirmishers pair well with each other creature role, including other skirmishers.

### Soldier Creatures

Soldier creatures defend their allies by drawing the player characters' attacks. They make excellent protectors for ambushers, artillery creatures, controllers, leaders, and support creatures. Soldiers don't need to stay very close to the creatures they protect—and it's better if they don't. A soldier who breaks away from their charge can lock down a threat far from the rest of the fight.

During combat, soldiers engage characters who are strong in melee. A soldier battles as many foes as they can reach so their allies can freely move. If more than one soldier is in a battle, they typically split up, each fighting  different character.

### Solo Creatures

Solo creatures are action-oriented (see "Action-Oriented Creatures"). Their villain actions and lair actions allow them to hamper and harm foes outside of the normal turn order. They're encountered alone and fight most effectively in environments with plenty of space to move around and find cover.

Solo creatures use every movement advantage they have, burrowing, climbing, flying, swimming, or teleporting around the battlefield on their turn. They focus on the character threatening them most, but also position themselves to target as many foes as possible with their area-of-effect features.

## Encounter Building

Building combat encounters using the game's core rules is complex, time-consuming, and doesn't work for the play style of many groups. The core rules state that most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight mediumdifficulty encounters per adventuring day. This is good advice for classic dungeon crawls, but in adventures that fit more into the heroic fantasy genre, player characters rarely face more than three or four encounters before settling down for a long rest. When GMs use the core guidelines for such adventures, heroes often aren't pushed to satisfying limits—especially at higher levels where their daily resources are vast.

The guidance in this section presents a more flexible way of planning a challenging (but survivable) adventuring day. It replaces the advice in the core rules and allows you to better dial in the challenge of an encounter with less preparation time.

### Encounters per Day

An adventuring day is the time between the end of one long rest to the end of the next. How many combat encounters should adventurers face between those long rests? The answer really depends on how difficult the combat encounters are. To help plan encounters, each level of encounter difficulty has a daily encounter points rating. See "Step 1: Choose Encounter Difficulty" for each difficulty's rating.

To give the characters a good but survivable challenge, fill each adventuring day with encounters that total 6 to 8 points over the course of the day. Here are some examples of daily encounter combinations:

- Two easy encounters (1 point each), one standard encounter (2 points), and one hard encounter (4 points), for a total of 8 points  
- Three easy encounters (1 point each) and one hard encounter (4 points), for a total of 7 points  
- Three standard encounters (2 points each), for a total of 6 points  
- Two standard encounters (2 points each) and one hard encounter (4 points), for a total of 8 points  
- Two hard encounters (4 points each), for a total of 8 points  

The daily encounter budgets have been calibrated so it's likely a party will run out of resources but survive the adventuring day. If you want a more challenging adventure day that doesn't ensure a party's survival, give yourself a daily encounter points budget of 12 points.

### Step 1: Choose Encounter Difficulty

Begin building your encounter by determining how difficult you want the threat to be. This section provides guidance on choosing an encounter difficulty and how many daily encounter points each encounter is worth.

Though this section uses familiar language regarding encounter difficulty, the meanings of these terms don't align perfectly with the core rules. For instance, for parties of 5th level and beyond, the core rules might call an encounter "hard," but under our guidelines the encounter is standard or even easy. And some "deadly" encounters in the core rules are merely hard encounters under our guidelines. These differences account for fewer encounters in a day.

#### Easier than Easy: Trivial Encounters

Trivial encounters require barely any effort on the part of the characters—like a group of 20th-level heroes taking on a handful of crawling claws or goblins. The characters are guaranteed to survive the fight and won't spend many resources. These encounters can be fun to occasionally throw into your game, but for many groups, the novelty disappears quickly. Too many trivial encounters can feel like a waste of time.

A trivial encounter is worth 0 daily encounter points.

#### Easy Encounters (1 Point)

Unless the characters have already depleted many of their resources and hit points, easy encounters won't threaten their lives. Easy encounters are great for adventures that don't give the characters much time to rest or for times when you want the heroes to feel like superheroes.

An easy encounter is worth 1 daily encounter point.

#### Standard Encounters (2 Points)

Standard encounters are the most common for many adventuring groups. These battles deplete significant resources and hit points. While character death is uncommon in standard encounters, it isn't impossible, especially if a player makes a poor tactical choice or just finds the dice are against them.

A standard encounter is worth 2 daily encounter points.

#### Hard Encounters (4 Points)

Hard encounters are typically climactic encounters with bosses and their minions—or anything else that puts the characters' lives in peril. Hard encounters are winnable, but the characters need all their resources, wits, and luck to survive.

A hard encounter is worth 4 daily encounter points.

#### Extreme Encounters (8 Points)

Extreme encounters are ones where the characters will likely not survive if they try to fight to the bitter end. Such encounters rarely or never appear in most campaigns—though if the characters are level 17 or higher, they can typically survive (or come back to life after) such encounters.

An extreme encounter is worth 8 daily encounter points.

> [!note] Avoiding Combat
> 
> The characters might avoid combat encounters through stealth, clever negotiation, luck, or other unforeseen circumstances. You have two options when this happens. First is to let the heroes have the extra resources going into the next battle—clever thinking should be rewarded! But if your group likes to fight, you can always add another combat encounter to the adventuring day (if it fits within your daily encounter points budget).
^avoiding-combat

### Step 2: Determine CR Budget

Once you choose the desired difficulty of your encounter, you can determine its CR budget. To do so, you'll need to know the average character level of the party (rounding down).

Using the Encounter CR per Character table, find the row that lists your party's average character level, then find the column that lists your desired encounter difficulty. The number in that intersecting cell is your CR budget *per character*—just multiply that number by the number of characters in the party, and that's your total CR budget to spend in the "Step 3: Spend CR Budget" section.

For example, if you wanted to build a hard encounter for a group of four 5th-level characters, you would multiply 2½ (from the Encounter CR per Character table) by 4 (the number of characters) to get a total CR budget of 10.

**Encounter CR per Character**

| Average Character Level | Easy | Standard | Hard | CR Cap |  |
|-------------------------|------|----------|------|--------|--|
| 1st | 1/8* | 1/8* | 1/4 | 1 |
| 2nd | 1/8 | 1/4 | 1/2 | 3 |
| 3rd | 1/4 | 1/2 | 3/4 | 4 |
| 4th | 1/2 | 3/4 | 1 | 6 |
| 5th | 1 | 1½ | 2½ | 8 |
| 6th | 1½ | 2 | 3 | 9 |
| 7th | 2 | 2½ | 3½ | 10 |
| 8th | 2½ | 3 | 4 | 12 |
| 9th | 3 | 3½ | 4½ | 13 |
| 10th | 3½ | 4 | 6 | 15 |
| 11th | 4 | 4½ | 5½ | 16 |
| 12th | 4½ | 5 | 6 | 17 |
| 13th | 5 | 5½ | 6½ | 19 |
| 14th | 5½ | 6 | 7 | 20 |
| 15th | 6 | 6½ | 7½ | 22 |
| 16th | 6½ | 7 | 8 | 24 |
| 17th | 7 | 7½ | 8½ | 25 |
| 18th | 7½ | 8 | 9 | 26 |
| 19th | 8 | 8½ | 9½ | 28 |
| 20th | 8½ | 9 | 10 | 30 |
^encounter-cr-per-character

*Given how low a character's hit points are at 1st level, there isn't much difference between an easy and a standard encounter

#### Companions and Retainers

For the purpose of encounter building, if the player characters adventure with one or more companions or retainers, consider them player characters but subtract 2 from their actual level. However, if a companion's caregiver is a beastheart, don't count the companion as an extra character—the beastheart and companion together have the equivalent power of one full character.

#### CR Cap

Some creatures who fit into your CR budget are too much for the characters to handle. Those monsters deal a lot of damage and create effects that are difficult to overcome for characters under a certain level. That's why the Encounter CR per Character table provides a challenge rating cap for each average character level. When you're building your encounter (see "Step 3: Spend CR Budget"), don't add any creature with a challenge rating higher than the average character level's CR cap.

#### Solo Creatures

When you use a solo creature, you shouldn't use the above encounter-building rules. Instead, refer to the CR cap for the average character level, then depending on how difficult you want the encounter to be, select one solo creature within the CR range indicated on the Solo Creatures Encounters table.

**Solo Creature Encounters**

| Group Size | Trivial | Easy | Standard | Hard |  |
|------------|---------|------|----------|------|--|
| 4–5 characters | CR cap minus 7+ | CR cap minus 5-6 | CR cap minus 3-4 | CR cap minus 0-2 |
| 6-7 characters | CR cap minus 6+ | CR cap minus 4-5 | CR cap minus 2-3 | CR cap minus 0-1 |
^solo-creature-encounters

For example, a group of four 5th-level characters has a CR cap of 8. A solo creature with a challenge rating of 1 or less is a trivial encounter for them, and a solo creature with a challenge rating of 6–8 is a hard encounter for them.

##### Low-CR Solo Creatures

The above guidance applies to most of the solo creatures in this book, but the ankheg is an exception—CR scales differently at low levels, and at CR 2, the ankheg has the lowest CR of any solo monster in this book. If a party has four or five characters, you can pit the ankheg (or another solo creature of CR 4 or below) against a party that's one level lower than indicated by the Solo Creature Encounters table. If a party has six or seven characters, you can pit the ankheg against a party that's two levels lower than indicated by that table.

### Step 3: Spend CR Budget

Now that you have your CR budget, spend it! Select creatures you want to use in the encounter and add their challenge ratings together until you get as close as you can to your CR budget. Here are some things to keep in mind:

- If you're building a hard encounter, don't go over your budget (unless you want to create an extreme encounter).  
- If you're building an easy encounter, don't go under your budget (unless you want to create a trivial encounter).  
- Remember that when encounter building, minions don't count as a full creature. Refer to the Minion Encounter Building table (in the "Minions" section) to determine how many minions count as one creature of their CR.  
- You typically shouldn't use more than three non-minion creatures per character. For example, a party of four player characters usually shouldn't fight more than twelve non-minion creatures at a time. Going beyond this limit could increase the difficulty of an encounter.  

For instance, if you're building a hard encounter for four 5th-level characters, you have a CR budget of 10 with a CR cap of 8. You could build any of the following encounters with these guidelines:

- A [bugbear predator](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/bugbear-predator-fleemortals.md) (CR 3), a [lizardfolk terrorsaur](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk-terrorsaur-fleemortals.md) (CR 4), and an [owlbear](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear-fleemortals.md) (CR 3)  
- [Dohma Raskovar](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dohma-raskovar-fleemortals.md) (CR 5), ten [orc blitzer](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc-blitzer-fleemortals.md)s (CR 1/2 minions), and two [orc rampart](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc-rampart-fleemortals.md)s (CR 2)  
- Four [gnoll abyssal archer](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-abyssal-archer-fleemortals.md)s (CR 1/2), a [gnoll bonesplitter](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-bonesplitter-fleemortals.md) (CR 4), four [gnoll marauder](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-marauder-fleemortals.md)s (CR 1/2), and ten [gnoll wildling](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-wildling-fleemortals.md)s (CR 1 minions)  
- A [gibbering mouther](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther-fleemortals.md) (CR 2) and a [time raider nemesis](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/time-raider-nemesis-fleemortals.md) (CR 8)  
- Five [ogre](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/giant/ogre-fleemortals.md)s (CR 2)

^start-slow

### Tweaking Difficulty

While these new encounter-building guidelines can help you target the difficulty of an encounter, it's impossible for any system to account for the countless details that vary widely from game to game. Keep an eye out for the following factors when building encounters, and tweak the difficulty as needed.

#### Party Composition

A well-rounded party with a cleric, a fighter, a rogue, and a wizard is going to handle combat differently than a group of four barbarians. The new encounter-building system works well for the former group, but a group of typical barbarians tears through combat with melee-focused enemies . . . and loses just as quickly against foes who force them to make a lot of Intelligence or Wisdom saving throws.

Keep the mix of character classes and other features in mind as you build encounters. Play to the characters' strengths when you want to ensure success. Exploit their weaknesses when you want to challenge them—but do so sparingly. First and foremost, the game should be fun.

You can increase the encounter's difficulty one step (for example, from standard to hard) if the encounter exploits most of the characters' weaknesses. Decrease it one step if it plays into most of their strengths.

#### Player Play Styles

The mechanics of fifth edition reward system mastery. Experienced and rules-invested players often build characters who are more powerful than average by synergizing ancestries, classes, feats, spells, and other elements of the game. Likewise, players who are less experienced or rules invested may build characters below average power. Depending on who plays in your group, you may need to tweak the numbers to challenge (or avoid slaughtering) the characters.

#### Magic Items

The core rules make some brief suggestions about distributing magic items, but there are no hard-and-fast rules about how many or what kind of magic items to give to characters. Some GMs shower characters with countless baubles and [vorpal sword](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/vorpal-sword-xdmg.md)s while others hand out one [potion of healing](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/potion-of-healing-xdmg.md) once every five levels. Most games are somewhere in between. Keep in mind that a group with many powerful magic items is going to have a much easier time at any level. And especially at higher levels, a group with few magic items will have a tougher time battling powerful creatures—doubly so when a party without magic weapons has to overcome a creature's damage immunities and resistances!

If a character has more magic items than the average suggested in the core rules, consider that character to be one level higher when determining the party's average character level.

#### Short Rests

The number of short rests the characters take during a day influences the difficulty of encounters, especially if the characters have important class features that recharge during a short rest (like the warlock's Pact Magic). A short rest after every battle makes things a lot easier, and no short rests at all makes the adventuring day much tougher the longer it goes on.

If the characters take more than two short rests during an adventuring day, add an extra 2 points to your daily encounter budget.

#### Environment

Combat encounters don't typically occur in big empty rooms. Hazards, terrain, traps, and even the shape of an environment can change the difficulty of an encounter. An encounter is easier if there's a choke point where the characters can easily fight a group of dangerous monsters one at a time, while a sphere of annihilation rolling through a hallway can make an easy battle turn deadly.

Similarly, you may need to increase the encounter's difficulty by one step if it includes an environment that deals damage to the characters but not their enemies, or if it inflicts the [blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed),  frightened, [petrified](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified), [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), [paralyzed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), [stunned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned), or [unconscious](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious) conditions or similar effects on the characters but not their enemies.

## Converting Ancestries

This book contains multitudes of creatures—but really, does any GM ever have enough stat blocks? The [orc rampart](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/orc-rampart-fleemortals.md) is a great soldier, but perhaps a kobold version of that creature would better suit your campaign. Or perhaps you need an angulotl who functions like the [lizardfolk terrorsaur](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk-terrorsaur-fleemortals.md).

To expand your stat block options, you can use the rules in this section to convert non-minion stat blocks from any ancestry on this list to another:

- Angulotls  
- Bugbears  
- Devils  
- Gnolls  
- Goblins  
- Hobgoblins  
- Humans  
- Kobolds  
- Lizardfolk  
- Orcs  
- Time raiders  

To convert a stat block to a new ancestry from this list, the creature should lose the defining features of their original ancestry (as listed in the following sections) and gain the defining features of their new ancestry. However, if the original creature's walking speed is 40 feet or more, keep their original walking speed.

### Angulotl Defining Features

An angulotl has the following defining features:

- **Size.** The angulotl's size is Small.  
- **Type.** The angulotl's type is Humanoid.  
- **Speed.** The angulotl has a walking speed of 20 feet, a climbing speed of 20 feet, and a swimming speed of 30 feet.  
- **Damage Immunities.** The angulotl is immune to poison damage.  
- **Darkvision.** The angulotl has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.  
- **Languages.** The angulotl can speak, read, and write Angulotl.  
- **Amphibious.** The angulotl can breathe air and water.  
- **Toxiferous.** When a creature hits the angulotl with a melee attack while within 5 feet of them or touches the angulotl, that creature takes 2 (`1d4`) poison damage.  
- **Hop.** The angulotl jumps a number of feet up to their walking speed as a bonus action.  

### Bugbear Defining Features

A bugbear has the following defining features:

- **Size.** The bugbear's size is Medium.  
- **Type.** The bugbear's type is Humanoid.  
- **Speed.** The bugbear has a walking speed of 30 feet.  
- **Darkvision.** The bugbear has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.  
- **Languages.** The bugbear can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.  
- **Bugbear's Inspiration.** Allied Humanoids within 15 feet of the bugbear who can see or hear them have advantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.  

### Devil Defining Features

When converting another ancestry's stat block to a devil, increase the creature's challenge rating by 1. If converting a devil stat block to another ancestry, decrease the creature's challenge rating by 1.

A devil has the following defining features:

- **Size.** The devil's size is Medium.  
- **Type.** The devil's type is Fiend.  
- **Speed.** The devil has a walking speed of 30 feet.  
- **Damage Resistances.** The devil is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from undane attacks.  
- **Damage Immunities.** The devil is is immune to fire damage.  
- **Condition Immunities.** The devil can't be [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed).  
- **Darkvision.** The devil has darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.  
- **Languages.** The devil can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.
