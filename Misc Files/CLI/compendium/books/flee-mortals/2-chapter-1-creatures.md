# Chapter 1: Creatures
*Source: Flee, Mortals!, p. 27* 

From swarms of spiders to ancient wyrms, the creatures who appear most often in your games are in this chapter. All the creatures are listed in alphabetical order. Refer to the introduction if you want to see the creatures listed by challenge rating. Most of the creature entries feature more than one stat block, providing different roles like action-oriented creatures, companions, minions, and retainers.

## Angulotls

> [!quote] A quote from Maxidroga, Deceased Squire of Sir Rogar  
> 
> This river water taste funny to you, Sir Rogar?

Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (ang-gwa-LAH-tulls (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Angualotl.html)) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces only accessible by water. They are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to an angulotl clutch without realizing it. Though angulotls prefer to avoid combat, when they're threatened or pressed, they turn deadly.

***Deadly Toxins.*** Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression—they don't need to be! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat; they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.

***Indicator Species.*** Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn't take much to upset it. While toxins don't kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path—even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most . . . and sometimes gives them strange abilities.

***Moisture Dependent.*** Angulotls breathe through their skin, but they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in very dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from a source of freshwater . . . unless it's raining.

### Clawfish

Known as q'ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Qukutxal.html)) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small beasts can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by choking or electrocuting foes.

> [!note] Angulotl Tactics
> 
> Angulotls prefer to battle their foes in partially aquatic environments that include lots of vegetation or other places to hide. This allows the angulotls to leap from the water, attack, and then retreat into the murk or bushes. Marshes, swamps, and jungle rivers make ideal showdown locations.
> 
> An [angulotl slink](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/angulotl-slink-fleemortals.md) can give combat an interesting twist if they grab a magic item away from a character with their Tongue Nab attack then retreat, changing a deadly showdown into a dynamic chase. Just give the characters a fighting chance to get back any stolen goods!

## Animals

Animals play a prominent role in every fantasy story and can be found in every environment. This section introduces new fantastical beasts and offers fresh takes on popular predators and companions.

### Optional Features

The timescape holds many more animals than one book could possibly contain. To aid in customizing the animals in this section—or even creating new ones—some creatures are accompanied by tables of optional features you can add to their stat blocks. These features are often based on realworld creatures the stat block can represent, and the table gives examples of those creature varieties.

***Challenge Rating Adjustments.*** If an optional feature increases a creature's challenge rating, this is indicated in parentheses at the end of that feature. If a creature's original CR was less than 1 and you select a feature that adds 1 to their CR, their CR increases to 1 regardless of whether their original CR was 0, 1/8, 1/4, or 1/2.

Since optional features increase a creature's power, they shouldn't be added to a companion creature without the GM's permission. This applies even to features that don't impact their official challenge rating.

***Repurposing Stat Blocks.*** You can use these tables to inspire the creation of various animals in your fantasy world—perhaps a certain island is home to bears who have webbed feet and can breathe underwater while hunting aquatic prey, or maybe a powerful devil is accompanied by an infernal lion who exhales gouts of flame.

You can also reflavor stat blocks and optional features to represent other real-world creatures. For example, an albatross isn't technically a bird of prey, but you can make an excellent albatross stat block by using a [bird of prey](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/bird-of-prey-fleemortals.md) with the Ocean Hunter and Glide features from the Optional Bird of Prey Features table. Similarly, the [little wildcat](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/little-wildcat-fleemortals.md) stat block can be handily used for a jackal, fox (give a fennec fox the same features as a sand cat), or dhole (add the Deadly Bite and Pack Tactics features).

### Bears

Known for their immense strength, formidable stature, and status as apex predators in forests, mountains, and ice sheets, bears are revered (and feared) as embodiments of nature's might.

***Ursine Variation.*** In our own world, bears vary in size and diet. The brown bear (a category that includes the grizzly bear and Kodiak bear) and polar bear are the largest land predators in the world—though despite their bulk, they can sprint toward their prey at terrifying speeds. On the other hand, the giant panda and much smaller sun bear are herbivores, while the odd sloth bear uses their long, curved claws to dig up ants and termites.

### Birds of Prey

Also known as raptors, birds of prey are the consummate avian predators. They hunt from the skies and dive toward their quarry at extraordinary speeds, either killing on impact or raking the unlucky target with their powerful beaks and talons.

***Avian Variation.*** Birds of prey include eagles, falcons, hawks, owls, vultures, and more. From snowy owls in the frozen tundra to desert condors, raptors rule the skies.

### Camels

As consummate desert travelers, camels are known for their characteristic hump (or humps). These masses of fatty tissue help regulate a camel's body temperature, and when food is scarce, the humps can be metabolized for nutrition. Camels also have large eyebrows and eyelashes that shield their eyes from the harsh desert glare, and their powerful jaws masticate thorny desert plants, wood, and the occasional unwise attacker.

### Deathhawk

This carrion bird is known in various cultures as the deathhawk, flesh-eater, scourger, or great devourer. They feast on rotting flesh—the more decayed, the better. With a wingspan of nearly 8 feet, bone-white feathers, and a piercing, blood-chilling shriek, even one deathhawk is a sight most mortals hope never to encounter.

***Harbingers of Death.*** Fittingly, a group of deathhawks is known as a foreboding. They have an uncanny sense of imminent bloodshed, and forebodings often circle above a besieged settlement or future battlefield for days, awaiting the coming feast. After the carnage, they linger for weeks at a time, slowly devouring the dead as they wait for the fresh bodies to become maggot-riddled corpses.

***Meal Prep.*** Though deathhawks prefer decomposing flesh, they hunt live prey if no corpses are available—or if they are preparing for their young to hatch. While one deathhawk guards the nest, their mate hunts, accumulating a grisly collection of flesh that has plenty of time to rot before the scaly gray chicks are born.

***Undead Hunters.*** Deathhawks can prove useful to mortals—particularly those who hunt undead—for these birds are not only terrifyingly intelligent, but eager to eat the flesh of the living dead. Organizations devoted to resisting the scourge of unnatural forces raise deathhawks from chicks and train them to hunt.

### Lightning Eel

Lightning eels have mottled dark-gray skin threaded with trails of silvery blue. They continue growing throughout their lifetime, simply adding vertebrae to their long, sinuous bodies. A lightning eel might grow to 2 feet long in the first year of their life, but ancient lightning eels have been rumored to live for half a century and grow up to 30 feet long—a small sea serpent!

Lightning eels live in groups of ten to twenty individuals of various sizes, known as a flash. They can hunt alone or as a group to take down entire shoals of fish—or larger, more dangerous prey. The flash migrates between bodies of fresh and salt water, following the patterns of storms and hurricanes. The sight of a flash circling just beneath the surface is a sure sign of an impending storm.

### Snowfox

These winged white foxes live in frigid polar regions and high snow-covered plateaus. During the winter, a snowfox's beautiful coat and plumage are primarily white with a scattering of dark-gray speckles. In warmer months, their coat takes on more brown, gray, and black, helping them blend in with the shifting terrain. Snowfoxes tend to live in mated pairs (for life or for a season) and raise a litter of two to four kits at a time.

### Swarms

A droning, chirping, or clicking swarm of insectoids is a surprisingly daunting sight. Though they be but tiny, they are numerous and united in pursuit of their collective goal.

> [!note] Content Warning: Insects and Spiders
> 
> If you or any of your players are viscerally bothered by many-legged bugs, stinging insects, or spiders, you may want to avoid using the swarms in this section—or instead describe them as some other Tiny creature with substantially fewer legs.
^content-warning-insects-and-spiders

### Wildcats

Felines of all shapes and sizes roam the wilds—and the occasional urban alleyway. Cats are usually solitary hunters who stalk their prey before bringing them down in one leap. Padded feet, sensitive whiskers, and long tails help them move nimbly and silently.

***Feline Variation.*** Many different cats live in woodlands, jungles, savannahs, and mountains. Big cats, like lions, cougars, and jaguars, use their strength to quell larger prey. Smaller felines, like ocelots, servals, margays, and even housecats, rely on their agility and reflexes to ambush their quarry.

> [!note] Animal Handling in the Wild
> 
> While Wisdom ([Animal Handling](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) checks are typically limited to influencing trained or domesticated animals, you can lift this restriction to allow your characters to attempt to influence wild animals, such as a hungry panther who sees the party as dinner. Allowing the Animal Handling skill to influence wild beasts increases the versatility of a skill with a very limited number of uses in a typical game. It may be that you allow any character to attempt to use the skill to influence wild animals or that you restrict this special use to specific characters connected to nature, like druids and rangers.
> 
> If you do allow Animal Handling to be used to influence wild animals, remember that skills aren't magic. The same way a single successful Charisma ([Persuasion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check isn't likely to turn a hostile bandit who wants to kill you into an ally ready to fight by your side, a Wisdom ([Animal Handling](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check can't turn a wolf the barbarian just punched in the face into a loyal pet. But it might convince the wolf to scurry off in search of easier prey.

While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the snowfox senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. In addition, the snowfox can use the companion's proficiency bonus for ability checks, and the snowfox gains temporary hit points equal to the companion's proficiency bonus at the end of a long rest.

## Basilisks

*They're great guard dogs. You just gotta raise 'em from eggs. No, no. Don't look her in the eye. She turned the tax collector to stone the other day when he tried to pet her. She's just a big softie, really.*

With eight legs, a scaled rough hide, and razor-sharp teeth coated in poison, the basilisk is a deadly threat—even aside from their petrifying eye beams. This dreadful creature can fell the mightiest of foes with a look, turning them into immobilized stone statues. Horrifyingly, the basilisk's petrified prey remain aware of their fate and surroundings, trapping them in an unending nightmare.

***Many Environments.*** One of the most adaptable predators, basilisks can be found in nearly any environment, but they prefer damp caves. Over time, their tough scales take on the color of their surroundings, allowing the bulky creatures to blend in better.

***Raising Young.*** Basilisks typically live in mated pairs and raise several younglings. Adults prefer to subsist on berries, fish, fowl, and carrion, resorting to eating their petrified victims only when starving. On the other hand, basilisk younglings can only eat petrified victims, and families of basilisk have been known to travel far from their nest to populated areas in search of prey for their babies.

***Dangerous Servitors.*** . Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to raise and train as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone as the basilisk escapes and runs amok.

Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas, largely due to their own limited options for companionship, commonly keep basilisks as pets. Both parties benefit from this symbiotic relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.

***Alchemical Properties.*** Alchemists have discovered that after a basilisk eats petrified flesh, the basilisk's gullet produces an oil that can be used to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.

> [!note] Petrification Is Death
> 
> A permanent [petrified](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) condition can take a low-level character out of the game like death. Some players might not like that a creature with a challenge rating of 3 can knock them out of the story. That's why the basilisk has the Alchemical Ingredients trait. Remove this trait for a more dangerous basilisk.

> [!note] Reversing Petrification
> 
> Petrification usually can't be reversed without the [greater restoration](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md) spell or similarly powerful magic. However, the basilisk companion's Lesser Petrifying Gaze is weaker than that of most basilisks, allowing it to be countered with a cure ailment power or [lesser restoration](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/lesser-restoration-xphb.md) spell.

## Bugbears

The oldest and largest of the goblinoids, bugbears combine remarkable silence with unusual strength. Most adventurers don't sense an approaching bugbear until a heavy weapon connects with the adventurer's skull. These fur-covered goblinoids thrive in almost any environment, inhabiting frigid tundra and sun-soaked plain alike—but good luck finding a bugbear tribe that doesn't want to be found.

***Survival Lessons.*** Bugbears can trace their lineage back to the earliest days of civilization, when surviving in a harsh world teeming with monsters was no easy task. The bugbears of that ancient era passed down hardlearned lessons to their descendants. Every generation evolved and innovated these traditions, forging a people of fierce warriors, silent hunters, and powerful mages. Though many bugbears live peaceable lives or fight in defense of innocents, those who turn to evil wield these lessons to form armies of marauders and assassins.

***Inspiring Goblinoids.*** So great is a bugbear's might and grace that they inspire others to fight on against overwhelming odds. Bugbears often recruit other goblinoids before a battle, but their inspiration doesn't end with other goblinoids. Clever commanders who lead humanoids know the benefit of keeping a bugbear in their ranks beyond their mere skill as a warrior.

***Prepared for Battle.*** Bugbear training emphasizes that preparation is key to winning a battle. They prefer to pick their battlefields, preparing an ambush area with traps, reinforcements, and escape routes. At home, they leave no gaps in their defenses, often maintaining secret paths or havens where they can regroup, resupply, and continue the fight if caught unaware by invaders.

> [!note] Bugbear Encounters
> 
> While bugbears work well together, each has unique traits and actions that bolster their allies. Using multiple types of bugbears at once can increase the GM's mental load and make it easy to forget things in combat. Before running a combat with three different bugbears, you may wish to get a feel for how they affect battle by trying one bugbear with other allies, like goblins or hobgoblins.

> 
> Most bugbears prefer to start a fight with an ambush. They pick a spot where they know their foe will pass through, set the area with traps, then hide with their allies and wait. When it's time to strike, a bugbear positions themself and moves as necessary so that as many allies as possible benefit from their Bugbear's Inspiration trait.
> 
> When commanding others, bugbears coordinate their allies to focus fire on healers first so that the rest of their foes go down more quickly. If losing a battle, bugbears retreat to a secondary location, where they can hide and spring out to gain the upper hand against any pursuers. These secondary locations are stocked with potions and ammunition and guarded by traps.

## Chimeras

Massive flexing claws. Lashing draconic tail. Nimble leathery wings. And not one, but three menacing heads: a snarling lion, a helix-horned ram, and a dragon with fire sparking in its throat. Many see the chimera as an aggressor, but few know its origins as a divine guardian.

***The First Chimera.*** The first chimera was a gift. A deity gave a devout queen this young guardian—one with the intelligence of a dragon, the bravery of a lion, and the tenacity of a ram. The queen raised the chimera to be a strong protector of not just her person, but of her people, who loved the chimera and their ruler. But neighboring lands feared the monstrosity. As a conquering force swept into the land, their first defilement of peace was slaughtering the chimera.

The queen's resulting fury was said to be felt by the gods. As she screamed, a nearby volcano erupted, spewing basalt and chimeras over the land. With fiery might, the chimeras overtook the opposing army and dispersed. Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.

***Fiercely Faithful.*** When a chimera acts as a guardian, almost nothing can shake that loyalty. They are viciously territorial over objects, creatures, and founts of magic they defend. Even when the charges they defend turn wicked, chimeras remain faithful, willing to lay down their lives.

***Corrupted Loyalty.*** Mortals who earn a chimera's trust can tempt and train the monstrosity to bring out the worst of their three parts: a dragon's greed, a lion's pride, and a goat's stubbornness. Such chimeras happily serve evil mortals.

***Tactical Warriors.*** Chimeras have many ways to keep themselves and their charges from being cornered. The lion head snaps up enemies in massive jaws and hurls them away, the ram head pummels them to the ground, and the dragon head bathes them in fire. The sound of the three heads crying together can shake even the most stalwart warriors.

***One Being, Three Heads.*** Unlike many other multiheaded creatures, a chimera has a single mind. Their heads work together, never snapping at one another over food, favors, or personality conflicts. The heads often express the chimera's emotions in unison, braying together in times of battle or purring all at once to show affection.

> [!note] Protector Variant
> 
> If you want to use the chimera as a bodyguard for another creature, you can add this trait to their stat block:
> 
> ***Protector.*** The [chimera](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/chimera-protector-variant-fleemortals.md) is divinely bound to another creature, who is their charge. When the chimera and their charge are on the same plane, the charge can telepathically communicate with the chimera, and the chimera knows the distance and direction to the charge. If the chimera is within 60 feet of the charge, half of any damage the charge takes (rounded up) is transferred to the chimera.

## Demons

Demons spawn in the Abyssal Wasteland, where evil and chaos meet. These creatures of incarnate evil need violence and suffering the way most other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture or tear apart lesser demons for fun.

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, with a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features—one might have an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another could have a human arm growing from their forehead.

***Mortal Alliances.*** Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Though these alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.

### Demons and Souls

Demons feast not on food or water, but on souls. These fuel their bloodthirsty powers, and while starved for souls, a demon can scarcely think.

#### Soul Count

A demon's stat block states the number of souls a given demon has already consumed at the beginning of combat. This number is presented right under their hit points in a similar fashion: both as a die expression and as an average number.

#### Soul Devourer

Demons can gain more souls by slaying other creatures, as described in their Soul Devourer trait. Unlike hit points, there is no maximum limit to a demon's soul count.

#### Soul-Fueld Power

Most demons have one or more features that require souls to use.

##### Passive Traits

Passive traits automatically take effect after a demon's soul count crosses the threshold described in that trait. The trait remains active until the demon's soul count drops below the threshold, and the trait reactivates when the demon's soul count equals or exceeds it.

##### Active Features

During an encounter, a demon can burn souls to use or enhance certain abilities. When they do, their soul count decreases by the number indicated. This cost is sometimes noted in parentheses at the beginning of an ability, such as "(Costs 1 Soul)." Other times, the text of the ability itself describes it, such as saying "the demon can burn 1 soul" for an additional effect.

#### Lethe

When a demon's soul count drops to 0, they fall into a state known as lethe—a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume. See a demon's Lethe trait for more information.

#### Soulsight

Demons have a special sense called [soulsight](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/senses.md#Soulsight), allowing them to perceive each creature, other than Constructs and Undead, within a certain radius. Soulsight doesn't rely on sight but counts as "seeing" for features that require sight. Neither physical objects (including total cover) nor supernatural effects can impede soulsight unless otherwise stated. A demon's stat block lists the radius of their soulsight under "Senses."

> [!note] Adjusting Lethality
> 
> Soul devouring makes demons deadly opponents. To give characters a better chance of living through their encounter with a demon, you can reduce the DC of the saving throw—or you can remove the saving throw entirely, and only allow a demon to devour a soul when a creature dies within 60 feet of them through other means. On the other hand, you might like to scale up the deadliness with more powerful demons! If so, instead of always using a DC 11 saving throw, you can set the DC equal to 8 + the demon's proficiency bonus.
^adjusting-lethality

### Demonic Hierarchy

Mortal scholars classify demons in nine categories—the higher a demon's category, the more powerful the fiend. Though demons don't use these classifications themselves, scholars are correct that demons have a hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there's a chance they may evolve into a more powerful demon. Though Category 1 demons typically become Category 2 demons after consuming just one soul, there's no known pattern to how more powerful demons evolve. For example, some Category 2 demons evolve to Category 3 after consuming just one soul, while others must devour thousands before earning a promotion. This evolution can be instant, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether these evolutions are aided by consuming souls that are especially corrupt or heroic.

The following sections describe the most common types of Category 1–5 demons, though there are many other types of demons within these categories.

#### Pitling

The most common Category 1 demon, pitlings resemble rodents or insects—but with gleaming green eyes, terrible body odor, and viscous, toxic phlegm. If a pitling moves to a new region with different wildlife, they slowly change form over time to better match the appearance of a local pest.

#### Ruinant

Beings with glowing eyes and tendriled maws, ruinants breathe with a sickening wheeze and have bodies covered in inflamed scars. These Category 2 demons aim to kill healers first, knowing that such tactics make the rest of their prey fall faster. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the ruinant's own body.

#### Tormenauk

The tormenauk resembles a hulking ape with a dozen or more extra mouths randomly distributed around their body. Though their brute force is formidable enough, this Category 3 demon also inflicts raw psychic pain by screaming from their mouths in different voices—often using the agonized voices of souls the tormenauk has devoured.

#### Wobalas

The wobalas prefers to kill from afar while protected by allies. These Category 4 demons press lesser demons and mortals into service, first using them as meat shields, then devouring them when the wobalas needs a soul.

Wobalases have wildly different physical forms, but each wields a flesh bow attached to one of their limbs. This bow fires magical arrows that imbue their enemies with despair.

#### Chimeron

When a demon evolves to Category 5, their four previous forms sometimes meld into a chimeron, a horrid conglomeration of maws and mismatched body parts. The chimeron feels the hunger of all their mouths at the same time, and no number of souls can sate them.

#### Category 6 and Beyond

After devouring thousands of souls, a demon who reaches Category 6 develops a unique form and individual identity—the latter of which persists through future evolutions. These ancient demons thrive in the brutal chaos of the Abyss, each commanding a squad of bloodthirsty fiends.

Category 9 demons—the demon lords—are the most powerful. Their names are whispered carefully, their power rivals the gods', and their schemes ruin worlds.

### Aurumvas of Meaningless Greed

Covetous is too soft a word to describe the avarice of Aurumvas (or-UM-vahs (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Aurumvas.html)). This towering Category 6 demon wears a stack of crowns atop his reptilian head. His gaudy robe of gold and jewels hangs open, exposing his bare chest.

Aurumvas hungers for riches just as much as souls. His private vaults in the Abyssal Wastes hold treasures his band of demons has slaughtered hundreds of creatures to acquire. All he does is gaze on them and want for more.

Understanding that one needs to spend wealth to make it, Aurumvas is willing to part with smaller treasures to hire lesser fiends and wicked mortals. Someday his hoards and hordes may cover the timescape while he rules from atop a pile of platinum.

## Devils

In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly against each other for power and control—a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Compared to other fiends, devils appear remarkably humanoid, but infernal attributes such as horns, hooves, tails, and wings still set them apart.

***Precarious Pyramids.*** The Seven Cities are built on a strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Draconian chains of command place each devil in service to a higher authority—typically a more powerful devil. While devils are lawful, they're always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.

***Silver Tongues.*** These winsome fiends can acquire great influence through corrupting mortal souls—who then become subordinate devils when they die. Devils are virtuosos with words, skilled at tempting and coercing people into performing atrocities. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals—greed, revenge, vanity—or just simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil's supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it's too late.

***True Names.*** All devils have two names: one they're commonly known by, and another secret true name. Every devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning the fiend or to strip them of their power.

***Hell's Defectors.***  Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some others do desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell's bureaucracy—for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it leaves open a passage to the Mundane World that an enterprising devil can cross through.

Some of these defectors cling to old habits, acquiring power in mortal spheres of business, law, or politics. Others, inspired by mortals, join adventuring parties or set out to explore the world. These devils and their descendants are often colloquially known as tieflings.

### Infernal Chancellor Lazivos

To reach the rank of chancellor, Lazivos (LAH-zih-vohs (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Lazivos.html)) has executed dozens of intricate schemes, uttered hundreds of deceptions into opportune ears, and positioned count less rivals into unfortunate—yet completely compromising—circumstances.

And still, he remains unsatisfied.

Lazivos now pursues election to the Court of Seven Cities. In the meantime, he gladly commands and exploits his assembly of devils to curry favor and acquire loftier connections. His agents manipulate mortals and collect powerful relics on his behalf, ever expanding his reach and strengthening his grip.

A consummate narcissist, Lazivos dislikes dirtying his own hands unless absolutely necessary. Even when forced into a fight, the infernal chancellor coerces his enemies into aiding him, weakening them even further.

### Summoning Devils

Ritually summoning a devil is not to be taken lightly. These rituals are costly and dangerous, and those determined to see it through are typically desperate, driven, or simply foolish. This section explains the rules for summoning devils, the costs involved, and the consequences of such a ritual.

#### The Ritual

To perform a ritual to summon a devil, a creature must meet the following requirements.

##### Material Components

The ritual requires the following material components, which are consumed regardless of whether the ritual succeeds (see "Summon Check"):

- 500 gp worth of brimstone  
- 500 gp worth of obsidian  
- 250 gp worth of magical incense, chalk, and candles  
- 125 gp worth of Celestial blood, blessed by a priest (if such blood is unavailable, the priest can bless 250 gp worth of Humanoid blood in its place)  

##### Personal Sacrifice

A creature who attempts to summon a devil must sacrifice their vitality as follows, regardless of whether the ritual succeeds (see "Summon Check"):

- The summoner rolls a number of d10s equal to their level or challenge rating (minimum of 1) and loses hit points equal to the result.  
- The summoner also expends half their maximum Hit Dice with no effect. (If the summoner has less than half their maximum Hit Dice available, they can't perform this ritual until they regain enough Hit Dice.) Hit Dice expended in this way can't be regained until the [greater restoration](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md) spell is cast on the summoner twice within the same hour, or by means of a [wish](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell.  

> [!note] Finding Components and True Names
> 
> Most of the material components required for summoning devils can be purchased at churches or magic shops. The characters might also come across these components in a cult hideout, an abandoned wizard's tower, or the lair of any creature who has cause to consort with fiends.
> 
> Characters might discover a devil's true name in a dusty tome after months of research, or they could hear it from the lips of a lesser devil with a score to settle. If you're using the domain rules in "Kingdoms & Warfare", the characters can discover a devil's true name with a successful Lore test (DC equals 10 + the devil's challenge rating).
^finding-components-and-true-names

##### Ritual Length

When summoning a devil, a creature can perform either an instantaneous or hour-long ritual.

A desperate creature can use their action to perform an instantaneous ritual, which has a greater chance of failure. However, the exacting steps performed in an hour-long ritual reduce the summon check DC by 3.

##### True Name

A creature who knows a devil's true name can speak it aloud when performing the ritual. Invoking a devil's true name reduces the summon check DC by 5, and if the ritual succeeds, it summons the specific devil whose name was spoken.

##### Summon Check

To finish the ritual, a creature must make a summon check. This is a DC 18 Charisma check, though the DC decreases if the summoner performs an hour-long ritual or uses a devil's true name. "Ritual Consequences" details the results of a successful or failed summon check.

Another creature can assist the summoner with the ritual by taking the Help action. They are branded with the same infernal rune as the summoner, as described in "Ritual Consequences."

#### Ritual Consequences

Succeed or fail, summoning a devil has weighty consequences.

##### Branded

Succeed or fail, a creature who attempts or assists in a summoning ritual is branded by an infernal rune on a prominent part of their body, such as their head, chest, or back. This rune marks them as someone who has tried to summon a devil. Communities and individuals who recognize the meaning of the rune may treat the summoner with fear, suspicion, or contempt.

##### Success

If a creature succeeds on the summon check, roll on or choose from the Summoned Devil table to determine what type of devil is summoned (unless the summoner spoke a devil's true name during the ritual, thereby summoning that specific devil). At the GM's discretion, other devil types can be summoned instead.

A successful ritual binds the devil to a contract with the summoner. The devil must help the summoner with a specific task, such as finishing the current battle or aiding in a single quest objective. At the GM's discretion, a devil may be willing to extend the contract, but this has additional consequences for the summoner's soul and requires further payment, often in the form of favors.

^summoned-devil

##### Failure

If a creature fails the summon check by 4 or fewer, no devil is summoned.

If a creature fails the summon check by 5 or more, a devil is summoned as in the "Success" section, but the fiend isn't contractually bound to the summoner and can act as they please. At the GM's discretion, the devil could still offer a contract—one that asks much of the summoner.

If a creature fails the summon check by 10 or more, they suffer the consequences of failing by 5 or more, and an additional planar entity—such as a such as a demon, an Elemental, or a Celestial—is also summoned. This additional entity is hostile toward the summoner.

## Dragonets

The tiny cousins of majestic true dragons, dragonets are much less powerful—and prideful—than their larger kin. Though true dragons are essentially immortal, dragonets are omnivores who only live for about a century and need food to survive.

Each dragonet has a traditional Draconic name, but they also choose a nickname reserved for clutchmates, close friends, and their mate or mates (many dragonets mate for life with one or more partners). An adventurer who befriends a dragonet might even find the dragonet bestows a nickname on their new friend. The Dragonet Names table presents examples of dragonet names and nicknames.

Although dragonets rarely practice spellcraft themselves, they are attuned to arcane forces. These clever creatures have an innate understanding of spells and supernatural effects, as well as a keen sense for telling truth from fiction. Dragonets eschew deception and lies among friends, and they have little compunction about calling out untrue statements with varying levels of tact, though they understand well the need for lying to enemies.

***Family Bonds.*** True dragons recognize dragonets as kin, and most will protect a dragonet in danger—or at least try to avoid killing any dragonet caught up in their conflicts. Many dragons, dragonets, and humanoids alike believe that dragonets were created by dragons long ago, much as the dragon god created dragons themselves.

> [!note] Variant: Dragonet Familiar
> 
> Particularly adventurous dragonets are eager to accompany spellcasters as their companions or familiars. Dragonets tend to be curious, gregarious, and fiercely loyal to their chosen companions. Those who hope to befriend a dragonet should take note that their preferred foods are fresh fruit and fish (raw, seared, or smoked)—though dragonets introduced to humanoid delicacies also become particularly fond of spiced or sweetened nuts.
> 
> ***Familiar.*** The dragonet can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with their willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the dragonet senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. In addition, when the dragonet uses their Truesight action, their companion also has truesight while in physical contact with the dragonet. Either creature can end the bond at any time.

## Dragons

*We fear dragons above all else. Not only are they an expression of annihilation—our oldest and most basic dread—but they are a symbol of everything ancient, inscrutable, and unconquerable about our world.*

Cultures across the timescape covet, fear, and revere dragons in equal measure. To mortals, dragons are the penultimate monster, second only to titans, and a fearsome challenge for even the greatest mortals. To dragons themselves, they are survivors, remnants of a once-great age brought low by hubris now forgotten.

Those who remain are unbroken by the passage of the ages, biding their time as they plot to rise again—but a dragon's biggest obstacle is their own kin. These scaled sovereigns despise nothing more than bowing to another's will, especially another wyrm.

***Primal Majesty.*** Though many lesser creatures have been named "dragon" over the ages, there is no mistaking a true dragon's visage. These beings of legend inspire awe and terror in all who behold them—a reaction dragons proudly see as their due. They are majestic creatures, unrivaled in physical might and magical ability, and they know it.

Dragons are immune to the ravages of time, and those who have endured grow ever more powerful with age. The oldest among them become fountains of primal creation, their mere presence reshaping the world around them to their will.

***Ageless Grudge.***  With lives spanning millennia, dragons have a perspective mortals can scarcely comprehend, and they often hold grudges for slights committed against them or their kin long ago. But some resentments predate even a dragon's own existence. Enmities boil deep within their blood, burdening them with the anger of a thousand ancestors. This is the price of their immortality—an endless cycle of spite that keeps each dragon from trusting anyone except themself.

> We made the choice to give you five serious ancient wyrms in this book instead of a greater number of unremarkable dragon stat blocks because every dragon battle should be memorable.

### Durixaviinox

In a cold expanse at the edge of the world, Durixaviinox (dur-ih-ZAH-vin-nox (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Durixaviinox.html)) lairs beneath the ruins of the draconic city of Vexinoth. Though many now call him the Ruined Providence, this frost-breathing ruin dragon once ruled as a benevolent and all-powerful emperor who amassed enough reverence to rival the gods. But Durixaviinox was betrayed by his sister Yserthrax, who conspired with Qazyldrath to destroy the city. The conflict killed countless dragons on both sides and Durixaviinox was left for dead, his body buried beneath the rubble of a once-mighty civilization.

But the Providence refused to die, bringing himself back from the brink through force of will. As Durixaviinox slowly regained his physical might over a millennium of wound licking, he swore oaths of revenge against his sister and Qazyldrath. He plans to bring an eternal winter to the Mundane World, making it a place fit only for those with frigid hearts.

### Forzaantirilys

The blood dragon known as the Ashen Song is a creature of ash and cinder, her body wreathed in flames that burn with an unearthly heat. Forzaantirilys (for-zan-TILL-ih-riss (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Forzaantilirys.html)) lairs in the heart of the world's largest volcano, and if the rumors are true, she can see and hear through magma and lava flows everywhere.

Forzaantirilys is an inferno of anger, and this burning rage makes her immune to all fires, including the harsh light of the sun. She hates humanoids for their belief they are entitled to the Mundane World, and she abhors the gods who created them. The Ashen Song also despises the wyrm Xaantikorijek, who killed her mate, Frezzelvarax (frezz-el-VAR-ax (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Frezzelvarax.html)), nearly a thousand years ago. She wants nothing more than to see the world consumed and remade by her fire, though she knows wanton destruction would lead to her demise.

### Qazyldrath

Qazyldrath (KAZZ-ill-drath (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Qazyldrath.html)) is an ancient creature of nightmares, a manipulator of acid and shadows, a monster who has haunted mortal minds ever since the dragon's wings first engulfed the light of the sun. This gloom dragon's venerable age is surpassed only by the fear they command. Also known as the Sun Eater and the Silent Decay, Qazyldrath features heavily in the oral tradition of draconic ancestries; they're said to be one of the progenitors of lesser dragons and the one responsible for the viciousness of dragonkind.

Though Qazyldrath hasn't been seen in millennia, their influence is ever-present across the timescape. Many elven dialects still use variations of the dragon's name for the word "eclipse." Some people believe darkness amplifies Qazyldrath's power, and the Sun Eater will one day return to plunge the world into eternal shadow.

### Xaantikorijek

Deep beneath the barren wastes of the world rests one of its oldest creatures—so old, in fact, that he has forgotten his own name. This storm dragon has come to be known simply as the Voice of the Ages—or Xaantikorijek (zan-tihKOR-eh-jehk (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Xaantikorijek.html)) in Draconic.

Xaantikorijek is a master of thunder and lightning, and as part of the first brood to hatch on the Mundane World, he predates most of his surviving kin. Legend holds that the Voice of the Ages once knew a secret that could remake the Mundane World in whatever form they choose—but the aging wyrm remembers very little of his own past. Whether this was the cost of surviving the doom that befell the dragons of old, a self-imposed condition, or some other magical malady, is unknown even to Xaantikorijek.

Once every few centuries, however, Xaantikorijek remembers a detail about his lost history. It is said that when this happens, his voice resounds worldwide as he relays the fact to all dragonkin. The dragons eagerly hope he may someday remember how to reforge the world with dragons as rulers.

### Yserthrax

In the deepest and darkest parts of the timescape, there are beings that should not be, touched by corruption beyond worlds. One such creature is Yserthrax (EE-sur-thracks (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Yserthrax.html)), a draconic abomination whose wings are lined with hundreds of emerald eyes.

Yserthrax was born a venom dragon, revered for her mastery of spellcraft and occult lore. Now, she has been transformed by the machinations of elder evils, her body becoming distended and covered with strange growths.

The Many-Eyed earned her name not only for her eye-laden form. She is widely praised as one of the most cunning and devious among her kin, sought after for her arcane talents, spycraft, and intrigue. Little happens among dragonkind that Yserthrax doesn't see; she knows every great wyrm's desires and could manipulate them into carrying out the will of the elder evils that bind her.

> [!note] Dragon Tactics
> 
> Dragons seek lairs with lofty ceilings (or none at all) so they can use one of their greatest defenses: flight. A dramatic encounter with a dragon can quickly become a slog if the wyrm lands and never moves around the battlefield. Dragons are smart! They know to use their long reach and breath weapon to make life difficult for their enemies.
> 
> Dragons choose extremely defensible places for their lairs, which are part home and part treasure vault. The wyrms rely on loyal guardians and an environment that is inhospitable to mortal treasure hunters and would-be heroes. For instance, Forzaantirilys makes her home in Mount Brazen, an enormous volcano that is hotter than the Seven Cities of Hell. Her treasure sits on an obsidian island floating in a lake of lava in the heart of the mountain. Just walking through the tunnels to reach Forzaantirilys's hoard would bake most people to death.

## Elementals

> [!quote] A quote from Atæshia, Queen of Ash  
> 
> It is in changing that we find purpose.

When the gods formed the Mundane World, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the universe's most basic elements—air, fire, earth, and water. Some elementals contain just one of these components, but the greatest embody multiple as creatures of ash, blood, ice, and similar reagents.

***Duality of Form.*** Elementals are mercurial creatures of transformation, creation, and destruction. Though the deities first created the Mundane World, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn't suit an elemental, they break it down with fire, wind, or another element, then build it anew.

Elementals themselves also change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are knights wrought of iron, lizards ablaze with fire, and angels of pure sunlight.

***Rebirth and Reformation.*** When an elemental dies in the Mundane World, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain strength. Should the spirit return to the Mundane World, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.

***Reactive Harmony.*** Each elemental can bolster themself or another elemental with the primordial power they embody. To maximize this power and to protect each other, elementals live and work in groups called *ishkrars*. This Primordial word translates literally to "family," but more accurately refers to a family that is not one's first.

***Driven Back by Mortals.*** When the divine host created humanoids, many of these mortals tore down what the elementals had built to make way for roads, buildings, mines, and war. When the elementals sought a peaceful resolution to this conflict, their diplomats were assassinated by evil mortals, igniting a war which the unprepared and disorganized elementals lost.

Surviving elementals retreated to remote locations, fortifying their positions beneath the waves, within volcanoes, and in other places uninhabitable for humanoids. Many elementals in the Mundane World hold the weakness of mortals in contempt; others don't fault humanoids, but instead blame the gods who created such selfish creatures.

> [!note] Sapient Elementals
> 
> This section presents sapient elementals that live and fight together as a band. Other elementals, called motes, exist in the timescape as well, but we didn't have the space for them in this book. Those elementals are less sapient than the ones presented here.
^sapient-elementals

### Crux of Fire

The crux of fire, often called a blazecaster, takes the form of a fiery lizard. They often live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity. These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar—and if they don't like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near.

While many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame.

### Crux of Frost

An entity of mirrored ice, the crux of frost is almost always covered by a frosted facade. They are commonly called frigid glintmasks due to their ability to imperfectly mimic creatures, inflicting supernatural terror on those they reflect. This fear makes the reflected creature more vulnerable to harm, their form and spirit withering to a brittle consistency under the crux's scrutiny.

### Essence of Mist

When an elemental's spirit enters the Mundane World, their form reflects an aspect of the world. When this reagent is the breath of a cold-blooded killer, the elemental becomes an essence of mist, also called a breath lurker.

The essence has the misty silhouette of a cloaked humanoid. A brutal weapon forms in their grasp as they strike, rendering their victims breathless.

### Essence of Storms

At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, or galeweaver, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon.

Galeweavers act as scouts for their ishkrars, and they're usually the first to see trouble. Also insatiably curious, the essences often swoop down to talk when they see travelers.

### Essence of Tides

An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of tidedrifter. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against regulars who sail or swim in their waters. With the tidedrifter's healthy sense of humor, it's not hard to win their friendship—but their relaxed demeanor evaporates if friend or family faces threat.

> [!note] Content Warning: Blood and Suffocation

> The [force of blood](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/elemental/force-of-blood-fleemortals.md), [blood seneschal](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/elemental/blood-seneschal-fleemortals.md), and [essence of mist](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/elemental/essence-of-mist-fleemortals.md) manipulate the blood and breath of their enemies. If you or any of your players find descriptions of blood or suffocation upsetting, you may want to avoid using these elementals or reflavor their abilities.
^content-warning-blood-and-suffocation

### Force of Blood

Forces of blood, also called blood sovereigns, are warlords and diplomats who equally represent the birth of mortal life and the moment of its ending. They could be mistaken for a massive humanoid clad entirely in black-and-red toothed armor, but in truth, their "armor" is blackened, gnarled flesh punctuated with veins of boiling red.

Mortal monarchs would do well to take heed when a force of blood's scarlet lance approaches. These elementals keenly understand mortals and never treat with them for idle purpose.

### Force of Earth

A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of rough stone. They act as guardians and historians to their ishkrar, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.

### Force of Iron

A force of iron, also called an iron stalwart, appears as a four-armed centaur made of malleable metal with a head shaped like an empty knight's helm. Most are staunch, loyal, and uncompromising. Some forces of iron even achieve fame by facing down wickedness where they find it—but others become wickedness, using their strength to vanquish anything that even mildly displeases them.

### Oracle of Storms

An oracle of storms, or tempest augur, seeks the power and wisdom of the thundering clouds. While some oracles form family groups, many choose solitary lives atop lonely peaks, searching for answers in the billowing clouds. Their divinatory magics display the world's stories in the sky, etched in lightning and cloudy silhouettes.

Oracles often choose to take the shape of creatures they see as wise, such as storm giants made of thunderclouds.

### Principle of Growth

The principle of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Principles of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.

### Sparks

On their home planes, elemental sparks are living motes of floating air, earth, fire, and water. When one of these elemental minions travels to another world, they take the form of an animal native to that plane. In the Mundane World, air sparks appear as winged serpents, earth sparks appear as rhinoceroses, fire sparks appear as bears, and water sparks take on the appearance of octopuses.

### Sunlight Nexus

A being of pure radiance, a sunlight nexus is easily mistaken for a winged celestial made of stained glass. Closer inspection reveals they're formed of jagged multicolored motes of solid sunlight that move together in a dense nebula.

Sunlight nexuses often serve as emissaries for their ishkrar. Their angelic appearance and restorative abilities instantly earn the respect of many mortals, which the elementals use to their advantage in negotiations. Evil nexuses masquerade as celestials to trick religious humanoids into doing their bidding.

### Atæshia, Queen of Ash

Atæshia (ah-TAY-shee-ah (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Ataeshia.html)) was among the first elementals to inhabit the Mundane World, and the first to strike back against the mortals who attempted to tame the wild world. Her army clashed with humanoids for decades, but her enemies' numbers were too great and her allies too few. As the tides of war turned against the elementals, Atæshia knew it would be better for the elementals to live, rebuild their forces, and wait for another day to take back what was once theirs.

Atæshia considers all elementals within her ishkrar, and many would fight under her banner in turn. She hasn't forgotten their great war, and she views mortals and the gods who created them as the greatest threat to the timescape.

***Protected Realm.*** Atæshia spends most of her time atop Tempest, a great mountain with an upper half hidden in an enormous storm. Powerful elementals at the peak manifest lightning and hail the size of apples to hide the Ash Queen's realm. Any who brave the treacherous climb find that the center of the perpetual squall contains a sunny mountain paradise. Here, elementals shape the land with placid pools, burning lava geysers, icy sculptures, lush gardens, and anything else they wish to manifest. The only requirement to stay in Tempest is to believe in the Ash Queen's cause and follow her orders whenever you are called upon. Even those who aren't elementals are welcome to stay provided they observe Atæshia's rules.

***Yearly Journey.*** Once every year, Atæshia travels from Tempest to her reliquary, a tower built in the ruins of her failed war. Here, she takes time to remember and honor the departed, holding a weeks-long vigil surrounded by elemental guardians.

These items conjure allies who can be immediately enhanced by the summoner, increasing the item's value and effect to the elementals who use them. Some elementals might also use items that create a damaging area of effect if their allies are immune to the damage's type. For instance, a force of iron who forms an ishkrar with several cruxes of fire and fire sparks can use a [necklace of fireballs](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/necklace-of-fireballs-xdmg.md) or the Shooting Stars effect of a [ring of shooting stars](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/ring-of-shooting-stars-xdmg.md) without fear of harming their allies.

This includes some not found in this section of the book, like the [fossil cryptic](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/elemental/fossil-cryptic-fleemortals.md) in the "Cave" environment of chapter 2. When you build an encounter with elementals, pay special attention to their bonus action options. That way, when initiative is rolled, you'll already know how each elemental can aid their allies.
> 
> Many elementals can use only their convocation once or twice per day. It's best to use these options at the start of an encounter instead of waiting for later rounds of combat, since an elemental could perish before they get the chance to do their cool thing.
> 
> You can create unique elementals by swapping one convocation for another. For instance, you could create an essence of storms who is infused with air and earth properties by trading the creature's Convocation of Air for the force of earth's Convocation of Earth. You could even rename the creature the essence of sandstorms.
> 
> When you swap the convocations of two elementals, pay close attention to each creature's challenge rating. You'll likely want to adjust the numbers for damage, saving throw DCs, and other effects to better match the stat block you're using. Look at that creature's original convocation to get some target numbers.

## Giants

Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains.

Though giants sometimes live near humanoid settlements, the latter often pass their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few "smallfolk" structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.

***Adaptable and Elemental.*** Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn't simply live on a mountain—they're part of the mountain, and it's part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, "Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?"

***Distant Cousins.*** Humanoid scholars usually assume all giants are related, though giants don't view their kin as brethren by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants tend to detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they're willing to be in the vanguard. Though giants rarely go to war with one another, their battles can change the very geography of a continent, causing earthquakes, storms, and volcanic eruptions.

### Fire Giants

Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma alike, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake. Though their reputation is one of violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding.

***Martial Artists.*** Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat up to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing straps to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into the perfect weapons of war.

### Zenith Aastrika

Once a lieutenant of the Sunlight Legion, Aastrika fought and clawed through the ranks, proving herself in battle after battle. However, she suspected many above her felt threatened by her meteoric rise, and her suspicions were confirmed when her unit was dispatched deep into the desert. There, Aastrika discovered signs of blue dragon territory and realized her superiors had ordered her into a trap.

On sharing her discovery with her unit, they decided together to desert the legion. Rather than face the dragon, Aastrika and her troops pursued spiritual enlightenment. They roamed the highest sunlit mountain peaks and deepest volcanic caverns in search of understanding. In one of these magma tunnels, Aastrika crawled deep into a volcanic crater and remained for hours. When she returned, she spoke of her body discorporating into fire and of newly unearthed wisdom, and in this moment, her unit became her first spiritual followers.

Returning to the Sunlight Legion, Aastrika used her newfound prowess and understanding to depose the leadership that sent her to her death. She then claimed her rightful place as warlord and spiritual leader in equal parts, preaching the importance of balance in both.

### Frost Giants

Born of soaring peaks in frigid mountains, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, which they carry like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory.

***Issenblau.*** Where frost giants make their home, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as issenblau in their tongue, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.

### Hill Giants

Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Though most hill giants want to be left in peace, if pressed, one can demolish a small village in minutes.

***Strength and Hierarchy.*** Many evil hill giants respect strength above all. They seek to dominate creatures they perceive as weak, such as ogres and goblins, while bending the knee to creatures stronger than themselves. Other hill giants instead become wardens of their smaller neighbors, driving off bandits and other threats.

***Easily Distracted.*** Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In times of battle, such distractions can draw the hill giant's ire, making them switch from one target to another.

### Stone Giants

Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity.

***Of the Stone.***  Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their home—marble, granite, or even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.

## Gibbering Mouthers

> [!quote] A quote from An Adventurer's Guide to Aberrations  
> 
> It's difficult to describe what a gibbering mouther looks like, but you'll know when you see one.

Gibbering mouthers are chaos incarnate. When these denizens of the ever-changing plane of Primordius travel, they take a piece of home with them. Reality bends to their will. The ground bubbles beneath them, gravity rearranges around them, and adventurers either run from them or are sucked into the chaos.

***Taxing Taxonomy.*** Gibbering mouthers wriggle as a mess of ever-shifting body parts. Their name was coined by an explorer who described seeing—and fleeing from—"a heaping pile of babbling mouths speaking in languages known and unknown." Other adventurers have reported similar amalgamations of bones, muscles and limbs, each more horrifying than the last. Only recently did sages discover these creatures shared the same chaotic ancestry, though their appearance is so in flux that they can't be perceived the same way twice.

***Chaos Gourmets.*** The gibbering mouther subsists on change the same way most creatures subsist on food and water. A gibbering mouther can treat themself to a feast just by finding their way to the Mundane World, where things are deliciously mutable. Though they can't make the trip on their own, gibbering mouthers seize any opportunity they can to travel, sneaking through mage portals and interdimensional rifts caused by wild magic. Some are summoned to the Mundane World by particularly malevolent forces, like zealous cultists, megalomaniacal mages, and others wanting to change or distract the world.

***Unconscionable Transformation.*** Living beings are especially susceptible to the reality-bending influence of the gibbering mouther. Those exposed to one of these creatures often return with a souvenir: an altered body. At first these effects are minor—their body might steadily flicker in and out of reality, or their face might sprout an additional nose. These effects always worsen, adding and rearranging body parts over time. Eventually, those who can't find supernatural help are transformed into gibbering mouthers themselves, roaming the Mundane World in search of a slice of reality to shift.

***Gibbering Friend.*** On rare occasion, a gibbering mouther finds an adventurer who embodies chaos. Such a pairing can bring about an unlikely friendship; the gibbering mouther happily serves as a stalwart companion as long as their caretaker provides plenty of opportunities to warp reality. In even more unique circumstances, an adventurer turned into a gibbering mouther might resist the call of chaos and remain with their party.

## Gnolls

Gnolls aren't humanoids, but hyena-faced fiends—created by a dead demon lord, they carry his evil legacy wherever they roam. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll's muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. The pack's eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.

***Born from Blood.*** The Abyssal Wasteland is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amidst its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas—bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of these predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As'sylrak the Warper. As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends "gnoll," an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is "to consume completely." And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.

***Ceaseless Hunger.*** The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn't receive As'sylrak's blessing; these tagalongs enjoy the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh—and they hunger for more, longing for a day when gnolls hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.

***Gnoll War.*** Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren't choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.

> [!note] Ravening Horde or Clever Killers?
> 
> Gnoll enemies in your game might be a horde of demonic soldiers who charge wildly into battle, fight the first foe they see to the death, then move on to the next victim. In this case, a gnoll has little care for their own safety, let alone the protection of their allies, as they wade into the fray full of bloodlust. This strategy works well for an overwhelming number of gnolls fighting together and gives your players the sense that their characters are standing against a relentless horde.
> 
> You could also make gnoll villains more calculated in their approach to violence. A smaller band of gnolls might employ clever tactics, waiting until night to sneak up on the characters, starting fires to cover their escape, and focusing their fire on enemies who threaten their victory the most. These gnolls work together in a cohesive group with fiendish cunning.

### Abyssal Hyenas

Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.

### Tusker Demons

Towering among a gnoll war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although tuskers usually follow gnoll commands, when they grow especially hungry for souls, they charge forward without regard to the allies they may trample.

## Goblins

Like all humanoid ancestries, there are many different goblins and goblin cultures, each with their own ideals. Known to themselves as *rogabrin*, meaning "more of us" in their language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoids in the world. They can be found in every environment humans occupy and places many others avoid, like deep cave systems.

Their proportionally long arms and prehensile toes make them equally well adapted to arboreal environments. Goblins live comfortably in treetop cities and subterranean environments with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. Others prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods of diverse cities.

Those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of the bunch, thieves and murderers shunned by their own people and driven to live on society's outskirts.

***Encountered in Groups.*** In society and in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely (and perhaps overly) confident. Such groups often become bandits that ambush travelers in their territories, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger bands may become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they're encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and flee when foes outnumber friends.

> [!note] Content Warning: Spiders
> 
> War spiders are really big spiders! If you or any players in your group don't enjoy descriptions of skittering spiders, you don't need to go into detail while narrating scenes with the creature. You could also turn the war spider into another creature, like a war lizard with sticky saliva.
^content-warning-spiders

***Mobile and Sneaky.*** Short, lithe, and long-armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who survive life in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies' knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.

***Goblin Magic.*** Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities—archfey, deities, fiends—for magic power. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.

### Skitterling

A six-legged, winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, appearing to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary blindness.

### War Spider

Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. The war spider's bladed legs skitter over enemy forces, while archers fire from atop a platform on the beast's back. During raids, the spider flicks their abdomen to launch warriors off their back into the fray.

### Skitterling

Queen Bargnot, Scourge of the High Road, leads the Jagged Edge Goblins in pillaging caravans. Before her rise, the goblins struggled, attacking only the weakest travelers in unorganized strikes. When she killed her boss and became the band's self-proclaimed queen, everything changed.

The Jagged Edges dug a sprawling network of tunnels in the soft earth beneath the High Road. Secret entrances allow the goblins to make coordinated strikes and disappear before their victims can organize against them. When not planning a raid, Queen Bargnot's warriors train, rewarding the best and punishing the lazy.

Queen Bargnot surrounds herself with warriors. She initially wades into battle with them, then moves back when half her hit points remain to command from safety.

## Griffons

With the head, front legs, and wings of an eagle and the powerful body and haunches of a lion, the griffon hunts anything they desire—even other predators—though they prefer to eat birds, fish, and herd animals. Griffons sometimes misjudge their prey and attack humanoids passing through their mountain or forest territories. They also fiercely defend themselves against anyone who threatens or gets too close to their nests.

***Coveted Mounts.*** Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions. Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.

Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by griffon beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs.

***Inaccessible Aeries.***  Griffons roost alone or in pairs on craggy mountainsides, in forests, or on cliffs overlooking the ocean. They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can't fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for several months in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then they remain in or near the nest as their parents feed the rapidly growing flightless chick. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly—and after that, it's only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby.

***Rare Breeds.*** Griffons come in many varieties. While the most common griffon is the leonine eagle, others include a falcon-panther variety and a bearded vulture-clouded leopard variety. The latter only feeds on carrion, and experts continue to debate whether they should be considered a true griffon or if they deserve their own categorization. Many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can return with evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types.

## Hags

When fear of death or hunger for power grips a mortal (often a druid, warlock, or witch), they might forge a pact with unseelie archfey. The mortal becomes a hag—aged, clawed, and cruel—a powerful representative of the unseelie in the Mundane World. In exchange, hags use their magic to bring about the misery that evil archfey crave.

***Hiding in Plain Sight.*** Though hags typically appear as older humanoid women, their true form is as vicious and nasty as their nature. They prefer to show the world a charitable face, but the general wisdom concerning hags is that the more beautiful their appearance, the deeper the rot within. However, this theory has never been confirmed, as few who see a hag's true form live to tell the tale.

***Dealmakers and Heart-Breakers.*** Since old age can't kill hags, the oldest among them accumulate as much knowledge, magic, and repute as ancient dragons. They are happy to share their wares . . . for the right price. Rather than ask for paltry coin, a hag usually bargains for something dear to the customer—perhaps their ability to love, the sound of their child's laugh, or their left pinky toe.

Adding insult to injury, those who deal with hags almost always discover the product is worse than advertised. Mortals should pay close attention to the precise wording of their agreements, lest they end up with a hex they thought would be a gift. Such curses often lead to the corruption of good but desperate folk, and some get so twisted up in fey deals that they become hags themselves.

***What's in a Name?*** Hags give themselves whimsical names, and older hags often select monikers like Auntie, Granny, or Nanny. Such relatable names help entice their favorite prey: the innocent. Who would fear Granny Gumdrops or Auntie Twothumbs?

***Collaboration and Covens.*** Hags are often viewed as solitary beings due to their foul tempers and tempestuous natures, but they aren't opposed to dealing with others when it suits their needs. Green hags form close relationships with local forest beings, night hags cavort with deal-loving devils, and sea hags bargain with other denizens of the deep to keep merfolk away from their lairs. The most infamous hag collaborations are covens, formed when three hags like—or at least tolerate—each other very much and choose to spend a life together.

Due to their preferred lairs and varying ambitions, hags typically work with hags of the same kind, though mixed covens aren't out of the question. While in a coven, hags share magic energy, increasing the power of each member of the coven.

***Loyal Underlings.*** Hags are treacherous by nature, and they only recruit creatures they trust to be loyal underlings. Most of these creatures lack sapience (such as animals, constructs, and undead), though hags sometimes command weaker fey who are too scared to betray them.

### Shtriga Nonna

Shtriga Nonna loves cats, cooking, and not much else. This ancient hag has lived high atop her snowy mountain for time beyond even the memory of most other hags. Shtriga Nonna is unique among her kind—she isn't of the forest, the night, or the sea, and the hag insists she has no need of sisters . . . at least, not anymore.

Rumors abound that she ate her former coven, and there's every reason to believe these stories are true. Shtriga Nonna enjoys dining on the flesh of any creature, especially if it's marinated with the fear and sadness born from making several bad deals with a hag.

Shtriga Nonna can look like anyone, so her victims fear everyone. Many swear she's a massive woman with claws of rusted iron. Others say she's a cat who steals the souls of the sleeping, and some describe her as a beautiful woman cooking tender meat pies.

The hag lives inside a mobile hut that walks through the snowy mountains on giant cat paws. This cozy shack appears inviting on the outside, especially its porch where she has tea with desperate souls who climb the mountain to make a deal. The interior of her home, which is much larger than the outside suggests, betrays her true nature. It's a cluttered, filthy place of wicked cats and cruel instruments for carving flesh.

## Harpies

> [!quote] A quote from Captain Longrock of the *Starcaller* crew  
> 
> Their song may sound mournful, but they know no guilt for what they do.

Despite their monstrous nature, harpies cast an angelic silhouette. Each resembles a winged human adorned with feathers along their back, waist, and chest. Instead of hands, they sport arm-wings, and below their knees, their legs end in birdlike talons. Their song, more beautiful than any worldly music, can fool its hearers into believing they've encountered a divine messenger. Harpies delight in luring such victims to their demise or carrying them off to distant roosts to be devoured.

***Dangerous Terrain.*** Harpies prefer to live in treacherous lands, often settling atop dangerous mountain ranges or on rocky shores. By singing near waterfalls, sharp rocks, or the dens of other monsters, a harpy allows the environment to do their killing—and if another predator makes the kill, the harpy always shares the spoils. When the deed is done, the harpy feasts while claiming any particularly shiny baubles their meal carried.

***Flock Together.*** Harpies live in flocks of a dozen or more. The strongest few earn the right to devour victims first, leaving bones for the rest. These weaker, starving harpies can only enhance the songs of others and can't perform a luring melody on their own.

***Giant Meals.*** Harpies often occupy the same rocky, hazardous territories as giants. If a harpy goes for a long time without a meal, they attempt to lure a giant to their death. When this risky strategy works, a harpy flock can eat for weeks.

## Hellhounds

> [!quote] A quote from Ek-Boshek of Azmekidom  
> 
> Everyone asks if good dogs go to the heavens. Naive fools! They should be wondering what happens to the bad ones.

Anyone can see that hellhounds are no ordinary beasts. Larger than most mortal hounds, their eyes glow a vicious scarlet, and their skin ranges from coal-black to blood-red. When angered—which is the vast majority of the time—their skin radiates the hellfire held within, and flames lick at the edges of their mouths, seeking release.

Hellhounds make for fierce and cunning combatants, working well with their owner and pack mates to surround foes. They drive prey into ambushes to maximize the impact of their fiery breath. Not only are these hounds immune to fire, but exposure to it hardens their skin, so they gladly unleash their breath weapons regardless of whether their pack mates are in the line of fire.

Though hellhounds can survive in most environments, they shun the cold and thrive in hot regions such as heated caves, volcanoes, deserts, and sites near rifts to the elemental plane of Quintessence.

***Bound to Serve.*** Fiends create hellhounds from the souls of canines and similar loyal creatures. These fiends often give these hellhounds as rewards to faithful followers—and sometimes to ones who are as yet unproven, but show great potential.

***Drawn to Power.*** Hellhounds tear the unworthy to shreds, but they show great loyalty and even tenderness to capable leaders who treat them well. Thus it's unsurprising that hellhounds thrive under a powerful trainer. Fiends, fire giants, efreet, salamanders, and similar creatures commonly command their respect; in particular, fire giants often form lasting and loyal relationships with their hounds.

***Bent on Destruction.*** Without the steady hand of their trainer, hellhounds become more chaotic and destructive. Like a bad dog left alone, they lay ruin to anything and anyone they can bite or set aflame.

***Redemption.***  Though most hellhounds are formed from the souls of beasts, fiends sometimes sadistically bind fallen humanoid souls that were once good people but lost their way, forcing them to serve as hellhounds. In rare cases, such a hound can be redeemed if rescued at a young age by a kind and capable trainer who can lead the hound on a gentler path. Upon its death, a redeemed hellhound is freed from the Seven Cities of Hell and moves on to a better afterlife.

## Hobgoblins

Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks, and one or more horns protrude from their head.

Like other humanoids, hobgoblins have no special inclination toward conquest, battle, or cruelty, and they can be found in all walks of life. But when the wicked among them fall on desperate times, some use their talents for the violence and subjugation of others.

***Synergized Tactics.*** Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies are often second to none.

***Playing with Fire.*** The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat that many other humanoids can't tolerate. Hobgoblins often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.

***Innate Magic.*** Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or necrotic energy, while others can turn allies invisible or run like Hell.

***Binding Bargains.*** Most hobgoblins consider their infernal heritage a thing of the past. Despite that, many still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature-hobgoblin or otherwise-who degrades themself by breaking their word.

### Grilp

The grilp—a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat—can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond these covert skills, however, hobgoblins value grilps most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which makes other creatures vulnerable to fire and necrotic damage.

### Slaughter Demon

When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a *grack'tanar*, known as a slaughter demon in the Common tongue. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.

Devils captured the grack'tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Their archdevil captors reward loyal hobgoblins by allowing the mortals to hold a grack'tanar's reins for a time. These slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe.

### Bloodlord Varrox

The brilliant tactician Varrox traces his lineage to the first goblin who made an infernal bargain to become a hobgoblin. Varrox's mother, the great bloodlord Fanoxa, raised him right alongside her army. The only home Varrox has ever known was a war camp, and his upbringing was conquest and bloodshed. When he witnessed her defeat and capture at the Battle of Redfields, he vowed to die an even greater conqueror.

The warlord enthusiastically embraces his legacy, seeking more power by forging deals with devils. These fiends demand Varrox capture more territory, which the devils then offer to greedy nobles in exchange for their souls and service.

Varrox encourages his troops to forge infernal deals for more power, and he keeps them on a strict training regimen so they might better wreak havoc. While on a battlefield, he expects tactical precision and sacrifice. The archfiends who treat with Varrox credit him with every pact his troops forge, granting him a little more might with every contract signed.

The devils of the Seven Cities of Hell have plans for Varrox. Once the hobgoblin amasses enough troops, they plan to send Varrox and his army out into the timescape to conquer peaceful worlds, some of which have no armies. For throwing a world into peril creates desperate souls—souls far more likely to make a deal with a devil.

***Camp Firefield.*** Varrox and his vanguard travel with a magical tent that was gifted to the hobgoblin by an archdevil. The tent contains the rest of his forces—when its stakes are set into the ground, the tent flaps open into Camp Firefield, a multilevel demiplane where Varrox's forces prepare for conquest.

> [!note] Blood-Infused Weapons
> 
> Many hobgoblin smiths individualize weapons for each soldier, using a drop of the warrior's blood during the item's creation. When a hobgoblin wields a weapon forged with their own blood, it harnesses their innate magic. Such weapons can light ablaze or ripple with negative energy, dealing additional fire or necrotic damage (already included in the stat blocks).
> 
> If another creature tries to wield a blood-infused weapon, it functions merely as a weapon without these extra damaging properties. At the GM's discretion, a blood-infused weapon wielded by another creature can deal its extra damage for the next `1d4` attacks made with that weapon. After its power is expended in that way, the vweapon ceases to deal extra damage for any creature other than its original hobgoblin owner.

## Humans

> [!quote] A quote from Baron Uthrak  
> 
> First a guard tower—say, five leagues in. That'll draw the orcs and elves and every other stinking thing that hides in the wode. And while they're fighting us over the tower, we clear the forest. Cut down everything from here to the tower. Make a path, then a road, use the felled trees for our homes. Soon, this whole forest will be green fields and farms. It'll be ours.

Humans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain. While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for excitement or power.

***Villains and Heroes.*** Recognizing their limited lifespan, humans often set their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and even aspire to godhood, all in hopes their names will be remembered forever.

Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more by the sword. Others turn to theft, often driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons—both exact a toll.

Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek dark desires in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.

Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.

***Risks and Rewards.*** Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive training explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment—knowing when to risk it all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent's mistakes and seize the advantage.

Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village or an ancient dungeon yielding a chest full of coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it's a game worth playing.

Swords for Hire. With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands. A human mercenary makes a stout ally . . . if you can afford their price.

### Baron Uthrak

Even as a young adventurer, Wigar Uthrak was known for his derring-do, formidable swordplay, and cutthroat leadership. He soon gathered a team of like-minded scoundrels, rising from bandit chief to mercenary captain. After winning the favor of a monarch, he was titled baron.

However, Baron Uthrak gambled poorly when he backed the monarch's younger brother in a failed rebellion. Stripped of his lands, the exiled baron now abides in the wild with his crew of miscreants, knavish ex-knights, and wielders of forbidden magic.

The consummate opportunist, Uthrak patiently stokes his war band's loyalty while awaiting a suitable power vacuum, set on establishing a new barony and increasing his dominion. Uthrak may even orchestrate such a vacuum himself, perhaps by helping naive adventurers do away with a stronger rival.

Baron Uthrak keeps his most loyal lieutenants close to him. He usually hides a contingent of guards and trickshots within earshot, ready to ambush any who displease him. He fights on the front lines of battle, trusting his magic sword, *Nine Lives*, to protect him. It has already saved his life six times, and Uthrak believes he can't die until the sword's magic is fully spent.

## Kingfissure Worms

> [!quote]  
> 
> "That's just four of us against the beast," remarked the youth bearing a sword twice his size. "And Jadis is the only one of us who's a proper worm hunter."
> 
> "There are no kingfissure worm hunters," snapped Jadis Mara, "only prey who refused to be swallowed."

Named for their infamous hunting technique, kingfissure worms terraform the earth as they move, building tunnels and crevasses to accommodate their enormous form. They then lie in wait deep underground. When they sense the vibrations of their prey above, they shoot their serpentine tongues through the crevasses, dragging prey from the surface into the worm's cavernous maw. Seasoned adventurers know to be wary when traveling past even the smallest crack in the earth.

***Intestine Inventory.*** The worm eats indiscriminately, swallowing creatures, structures, and precious gems alike. The wealth inside a kingfissure worm would put any dragon's hoard to shame, though the worm cares nothing for treasure and knows nothing of the spoils lodged in their labyrinthine intestines. Few people have seen the inside of a kingfissure worm and lived, but those who do usually escape with a precious souvenir or two.

***Home Renovators.*** Most worms build a den of tunnels and fissures, remaining in it for as long as the pickings on the surface are good and they aren't disturbed. When a kingfissure worm seeks a new home, they target areas with abundant food—occasionally leading to villagers waking up to find their surrounding lands have been terraformed overnight. Residents of such lands generally have two choices: pack up and leave, or prepare for battle. If a worm is somehow defeated, all manner of creatures and communities try to lay claim to the worm's underground structures. These empty dens make wonderful war bunkers, isolated workshops, and even highly defensible villages.

***Unstoppable Force.*** The kingfissure worm is a species determined to outrun, outlast, and out-eat every other living creature. Though the monster might be slowed by a display of great power, only death stops them. Some scholars theorize that when a kingfissure worm dies, their tongues detach and grow into full-fledged worms.

***Unlikely Symbiosis.*** Some nomadic communities or adventurers travel dangerous lands with the help of an unusual guardian—a juvenile kingfissure worm. So long as the people provide a steady supply of food for the worm, the kingfissure follows dutifully. And if the people attract monsters from above, the worm defends their companions while enjoying an extra meal.

## Kobolds

Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry centurion, they pose a significant threat.

***Defensive Masters.*** In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary; every warrior carries a shield into battle, and soldiers defend each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold's shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.

Kobold legionaries may join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.

***Unconventional Tactics.*** Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn't take them seriously. Their foes haven't experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy mechanical dragons and flaming spike pit traps.

Tiny Dragons. Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons—and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant chromatic, metallic, or crystalline scales; as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives under the patronage of a dragon adopts the color of their patron's scales over several generations.

### Shieldscale Drangolin

Kobolds train drangolins—draconic pangolins—to dig residential tunnel networks and neutralize enemy fortifications. While drangolins can curl into balls and smash through obstacles, kobold tacticians prefer to go under walls instead of through them. After burrowing, the drangolin erupts into the center of an enemy camp, then kobold legionaries pour out through the tunnel.

***Made of Shields.*** Kobold legions decorate their drangolin's scales to match their own shields' designs, and warriors consider it a good omen when the scale they painted blocks a blow. When a drangolin loses a scale in battle, it's gifted to a warrior to serve as their shield.

> [!note] Deadly Kobolds!
> 
> The kobolds in this book are built to work together. We found out during playtesting that they worked a little too well together after these little lizards murdered several dozen player characters. As a result, we reduced the power of the kobolds quite a bit, but a squad of these small dragons is still a formidable force against squishy 1st-level characters. One unlucky critical hit against a 1st-level wizard spells that hero's doom.
> 
> When employing these kobolds against a 1st-level party, use the kobolds with a challenge rating of 1 or lower (unless you're looking to make things deadly).

If you want 1st-level characters battling it out against an entire kobold legion, that's what the tiro is for.

## Lightbenders

Lightbenders prowl deserts, plains, forests—any sunbathed wilderness. Their adaptations make them skilled daylight predators. This monstrous creature's fur bends and refracts light from the surrounding environment, producing mirages that distract and confuse their prey—hence their name.

***Hidden Hunters.*** At a distance, a lightbender looks akin to a regular lion, but closer inspection reveals their glowing eyes, iridescent mane, and pair of lashing tails spiked with refractive crystals. The lightbender's pelt magically warps light around them to disguise their movement, allowing them to teleport while leaving behind a past visual imprint. Unsuspecting prey rarely realize they're staring at an afterimage of the lightbender until the fearsome creature pounces.

***Prized Manes.*** Both male and female lightbenders have the distinctive mane, which is highly prized for its light-displacing qualities and can be fashioned into a mantle of the lightbender, though only a few mages possess the knowledge to do so.

***Protective Companions.*** Though lightbenders are typically solitary creatures, they sometimes cross into another lightbender's territory to help protect a newborn litter of kittens. A few people have succeeded in taming lightbenders as guards or hunting animals, and if treated well, they can make for loyal protectors, often viewing their smaller humanoid companions as surrogate kittens.

At the GM's discretion, the mane of a lightbender companion can't be used to create a mantle—in part because the companion's life among other creatures leaves them with a smaller mane, and in part because this prevents adventurers from hacking their friend to pieces.

## Lizardfolk

Lizardfolk prefer warm, tropical climes, but they're willing to settle in any humid region—the more moisture in the air, the better. Even in colder climates, lizardfolk can be found in any sufficiently marshy environment. Bogs and wetlands are favorites.

Their scales protect both against weapons and the moisture in their native environments. Coloring and hue vary wildly with environment and diet.

Lizardfolk aren't especially hostile unless they feel their territory is threatened—which they often feel, because it often is. But for respectful travelers, entering lizardfolk territory need be no great hardship. Lizardfolk cultures often take up a specific trade, like boatmaking, fletching, weaving, or navigating, and they sell their services to travelers in need, including lizardfolk from other places.

***Homeland Protectors.*** Adventurers cross paths with lizardfolk while trekking through their homelands. The reptilian humanoids watch travelers who skirt too close to sources of food and shelter, attacking those who take more than they need. Many lizardfolk dwell in caverns and abandoned ruins for protection. Treasure-seekers who delve into these places are typically given one warning before the attack begins.

***Focused and Loyal.*** Most lizardfolk speak plainly, viewing blunt honesty as a sign of respect. When they make a vow or personal promise, they do all they can to honor that word. Lizardfolk who swear to destroy an enemy follow their quarry to the ends of the earth.

***Marshland Tyrants.*** In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory. But there are always other local lizardfolk tribes who oppose such aggressive, expansionist posturing; they often seek the aid of others who value freedom from tyranny.

## Manticores

A weary traveler hears a clarion call through the forest or friendly voices from a rocky shelter, and their heart leaps at the promise of refuge—only to find themself at the mercy of serrated teeth and poisoned spikes. In a manticore's territory, people go missing without a trace. These fearsome creatures carve out their hunting grounds in forests near small villages, mountain passes where caravans travel, and other locations with plentiful wildlife. While manticores can subsist on a carnivorous diet of any nearby prey, their choicest meal is humanoid flesh.

***Uncanny Appearances.*** A manticore has a lion's body, a dragon's wings, and a scorpion's tail barbed with spines, but their most unnerving trait is their humanoid face. Owing to a quirk of magical evolution, manticores develop the features of common mortal lineages that populate their region of birth. For example, a manticore in an area densely populated by tieflings inherits fiendish eyes and devilish horns. Manticores are born with an inherent understanding of a regional language, but they can speak only through mimicking that which they've heard—a talent manticores use to lure in prey.

***Heralds of Death.*** Manticores have a magical howl like a trumpet. This haunting sound not only terrifies creatures, but makes them more susceptible to the manticore's bite. While on the hunt, manticores often take to the skies, shooting poison-tipped spikes from their tail to weaken their victims before howling and closing in.

***Ferocious Companions.*** A manticore who develops a taste for humanoids can rarely be tamed. But a young manticore who has yet to cut their teeth on such flesh can be raised into a fearsome ally. After a trained manticore companion finally tastes delicious humanoid flesh, they typically remain loyal to their caregiver.

## Medusas

Hunted as monsters with no thought given to their nature or origin, few creatures are as underestimated and misunderstood as medusas. Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god—but while some medusas embrace wickedness, others simply fight for their lives against ignorant hunters.

***Cursed for Defiance.*** When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, the deity may curse them to live as a medusa. The offender's skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone.

The gods who use this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude—or to places haunted by creatures who don't judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories.

***Warriors for Good or Ill.*** Though they might be secluded, medusas rarely stay idle. Many plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them. Others embrace their new gifts, building stone gardens of victims who foolishly hunted or harmed them.

***Serpentine Reflexes.*** While the medusa's stone gaze is legendary, they also can move and strike as swiftly as a snake. This enhanced dexterity makes them incredible archers, and most prefer to fight at range.

***Lifting the Curse.*** The deity who inflicted a medusa's curse can rarely be convinced to lift the punishment, usually by undertaking an impossible task in the god's name or making a threat they can't ignore. Some sages claim ancient rituals can undo a god's curse, but these lost secrets are hidden by wrathful divine servants—and performing such a ritual would almost certainly entail great sacrifice.

### Medusa Lairs

Medusas find privacy and solace in the shadows, often occupying abandoned ruins in lonely mountains or caves with lofty ceilings. Statues of a medusa's victims usually litter the area.

### Lady Emer

When Lady Emer was human, she excelled as a scout in the mercenary Order of the Ouroboros. As her fame grew, she openly proclaimed that one day she would ascend to godhood. Emer hired bards to sing of her inevitable rise to the heavens, and their words reached the ears of the gods. Those lyrics damned Emer—but she saw her transformation not as a curse, but as an advantage, and her ambitions grew.

The leaders of the Order of the Ouroboros accepted Emer's new form as a unique opportunity. She secretly serves the order as an assassin, though most members don't realize it. The order pays her and she gets the job done, no questions asked. In exchange for her service, the order also allows Emer access to their library. The medusa takes promising tomes back to her lair, where she searches for secrets to help her achieve godhood.

Although Emer lives in an abandoned keep in the high mountains, she maintains it with an eye for modern fashion and elegant comfort. The garden courtyard of her keep boasts a unique collection of statues—targets who needed to disappear but might still be useful someday

The extroverted Lady Emer craves company, but members of her order rarely visit and never stay for long. The medusa is confident that if she were to amass enough power to claim leadership, then she could come out of the shadows and use the order's resources to achieve her divine goals.

## Mimics

> [!quote] A quote from Mimsen Ickus, honorary knight of the Ivy Irons  
> 
> You could steer clear of abandoned treasure chests, ignore the cries of kittens, and stay out of dark alleys for the rest of your life. Even so, a mimic can ambush you out of the clear blue sky.

For the cocky adventurers heedless of danger, a mimic is as deadly as a dragon. These amorphous creatures possess an unmatched ability to disguise themselves as any object, from furniture to treasure. Mimics learn what their victims want and use it to lure prey into their serrated teeth.

A mimic can make their home in any environment. So long as the area has prey and places to hide—among tree branches, along the faults of a cliff, or behind the baubles of a crowded bazaar stall—a mimic can wait for the perfect moment to strike.

***Sticks to You.*** A mimic can make any part of their skin sticky. This allows them to climb most surfaces and attach to unfortunate creatures who touch them, which is why mimics in dungeons often disguise themselves as tempting treasures.

***Panic Shifting.*** When a mimic feels pain, they can quickly compress their body into a dense object, popping a bouquet of boney spikes out of their skin. Threatened mimics can remain in this form indefinitely, and they often use it as a warning sign to predators that they are hard to swallow.

***Mimic Sounds.*** While mimics don't understand language, they can mimic sounds they hear—including human speech. They often cleverly use a former victim's pleas for help to attract would-be heroes as the mimic's latest meal.

***Well-Fed Companions.*** When a mimic's hunger is satisfied, they become docile. Most can wait weeks between meals, sitting patiently in the form of a barrel or rock. If a daring adventurer feeds a mimic until it is docile, the monstrosity may become fond of that hero. They follow and defend this reliable food source, and if the bond grows strong enough, they may even allow the adventurer to wear them like clothing.

Used as Distractions. Spies, thieves, and others who wish to walk into guarded locations unnoticed plant a mimic as a distraction just outside the restricted area they need to enter. The mastermind can slip in during the mimic's initial rampage and then more easily sneak out while the guardians spread thin throughout the complex, poking every vase and floor tile with a halberd to make sure there are no more monstrosities in the area.

***Unseen Assassins.*** Hired killers find a relationship with a mimic can be quite profitable, as the assassin can infiltrate their target's space and leave the shapechanger to do the dirty work. These trained mimics can lie in wait for days, pretending to be a benign chest or wardrobe. There is some risk involved, since the mimic could devour someone other than the intended target, tipping off the real quarry. A panicked mimic might run back to the handler, leading the authorities right to the person responsible. But assassination is risky business!

## Minotaurs

Despite their reputation, most minotaurs aren't evil—but all are fearsome. These unusual creatures are a study in contrasts. Their imposing humanoid body is muscular with patches of thick hair. Their head is that of a massive horned bull, and their soft eyes convey a soulful intelligence mingled with smoldering intensity.

***Primal Rage.*** Minotaurs burn with fury. Some constantly desire to unleash this destructive energy on the world, and they attack anyone or anything that crosses their path. Others make it a point of pride to control their rage, only fighting when survival demands it.

Regardless, once combat begins, minotaurs relish charging at foes with their great horns. In the heat of battle, a minotaur charges from one foe to the next, only retreating if victory is entirely impossible.

***Labyrinthine Origins.*** The first minotaur was once the human warrior Thesia "The Bull" Danaria, who dared challenge the Beast Lords of Kham. When her revolution was crushed, the Lords of Kham used their beastmagics to twist Thesia's mortal body into a human-bull hybrid prone to fits of violent rage. The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia's anger—until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love. New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other maze-like terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, a few can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement.

***Deep Bonds.*** Even evil minotaurs can be fiercely loyal friends, gladly charging into certain death for those they trust. These chosen friends never suffer the creature's ire—but gods help them if they betray the minotaur.

## Ogres

Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres still outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life.

***Extreme Emotions.*** Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross; you're more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart's desire, be it food, riches, or friendship.

Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place.

***Savory Stories.*** Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories end tragically, each with a different villain—from deceptive mages to talking cats—swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs. The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences.

***Aristocracy of Bullies.*** When wicked ogres gather more food than they can stomach or riches than they can spend, they use the excess to tempt their kin into working for them. These petty rulers make other ogres grovel at their feet for table scraps, then send them out into the world to steal more. Many ogre communities form around these arrogant aristocrats—but few such leaders die of old age, as the ambition and emotions of their subjects bring about violent ends.

## Olothec

> [!quote] A quote from Ithu'rath the All-Seeing  
> 
> When I return you to your primal state, you will thank me and then beg to serve. You will help others see that the only way forward is a return to the ancient times.

Protean in form, beings of nearly pure intellect, the old ones think in alien geometric logic. Their name for themselves is unrecorded, but sages believe they are the oldest beings in the timescape and simply call them "old ones." Synlirii refer to them as olothec (*OH-luh-thek*)—"ancient enemies." But some humanoid scholars have noted this term bears an uncanny similarity to another archaic synlirii word meaning "ancient ancestor."

### Immortal Evil

Across countless cultures and ancestries, olothec feature in nightmares and temple friezes alike. While their origins are obscure and may never be known, their hatred of the Mundane World and every living thing in it is well recorded. Olothec channel psionic energy beyond any mortal power, surpassing even the voiceless talkers. To them, a living creature who can't reshape their own flesh is repugnant, an unnatural abomination requiring eradication—or transformation.

### Agents of Chaos

Olothec consider the primordial chaos that spawned them as the ideal state of existence. They have long warred against the voiceless talkers, loathing their constant manipulation and refinement of evolutionary forces. Where olothec lair in forgotten sea tunnels and beneath ancient ruins, they surround themselves with slime servants—humanoids, beasts, aberrations, and others, all devolved to a perfect physical and mental state.

### Primordial Form

At first sight, an olothec seems like little more than a rippling mass of tentacles, twisting around each other like a shifting shroud. Creatures who get too close discover each of those tentacles ends in a ravenous mouth set with razor-sharp teeth. Each mouth is tipped by a cluster of three eyes that focus the olothec's relentless attacks. In water or on land, fetid slime coats the aberration, protecting them against attackers and acting as a conduit for their fearsome psionic power.

### Mutations of the Flesh

Millennia of practice allow olothec to perfect their psionic abilities that devolve and transform their victims into primordial life forms. Exposure to the psionic slime of an olothec's tentacles can change a creature into a mindless, ooze-covered thrall. The olothec also has a special power that can transform humanoids into hybrid fish people. The most powerful olothec have unique powers that further warp flesh.

> [!note] Content Warning: Body Horror

^content-warning-body-horror

[Olothec](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/aberration/olothec-fleemortals.md)

### Ithu'rath the All-Seeing

Ithu'rath (*ith-YOU-rath*), called the All-Seeing by the slime servants who worship them as a living god, stole forth from ocean depths centuries ago to conquer humanoid lands. The olothec followed the courses of lakes and rivers across a half-dozen realms, leaving death and mayhem in their wake. But upon arriving at the remains of Castle Wrathrock, a war-shattered lakeside ruin, the olothec recognized a home suitable for enacting their long-term plan for dominion.

Over the decades since, Ithu'rath has been breeding an army of slime servants in the flooded caverns beneath Wrathrock, preparing for a day when their army will spill forth to seize the rich lands nearby. A humanoid gang known as the Havoc Host serves the olothec; in exchange for the promise of power in the new order, the gang smuggles slime servant agents into caverns and waterways beneath nearby settlements.

Explorers who slip past Wrathrock's slime servant patrols must navigate the collapsing tunnels and passageways that fill the castle. These treacherous halls are all coated with thick slime, allowing Ithu'rath to use their swimming speed to hunt intruders in their lair.

[Ithu'rath](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/npc/ithurath-fleemortals.md)

## Orcs

In a long-lost language, the word *oruk*—"blood fire"—described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as *kanin* in their own tongue, they also use "orc" with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.

Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They've settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics.

Though orcs are no more likely to stand in the adventurers' way than any other folk, those who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.

***Relentlessly Tough.*** Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they're excited or driven. Their hair, which can range from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.

Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with "blood fire," glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white respectively.

***Innate Power.*** The intense power of an orc's spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc conduits hone their magic into singular affinities that are easy to manipulate. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature's spirit.

### Mohler

Mohlers are spined, pig-like beasts that corkscrew through the ground faster than they can run. Originating from deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface.

Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests—and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield and knock the orcs' enemies off their feet.

***Mohler Companions.*** When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.

### Scyza

Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. Orcs adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride the scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts.

The scyza's trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.

### Dohma Raskovar

Dohma Raskovar is the latest in a long line of leaders—known as dohmas—of the Ivory Throne, a band of mercenaries. Under Raskovar's leadership, the throne has grown to over a hundred strong, and now they handle multiple contracts simultaneously, occasionally banding together to fight as a single unit in battle.

Raskovar runs the throne from the Hanging Tree, his tavern where he plays the role of barkeep. Here, clients in the know can discreetly indicate their desire to hire bounty hunters, cutthroats, or thieves by ordering a boiling oil, a mundane blend of whiskey and rum that appears on no menu.

Once the drink is ordered, Raskovar himself appears at the table, ready to do business. He prides himself on remaining politically neutral and treating all potential customers as equals, something that chafes a few of his clients. Many local nobles have stormed out of the Hanging Tree in a rage after Raskovar refused to use the proper forms of address—only to return later when their situation is more desperate, and pride too costly.

***Life of Luxury.*** Dohma Raskovar enjoys the finer things in life—nice clothes, fine drink, and delicious food. He shares these comforts with members of the Ivory Throne and others he trusts enough to let into the restricted areas of the Hanging Tree.

Conduits, forcecallers, and terranovas get close to the action but avoid melee. Orc ramparts serve as protectors for these mages battling any who dare challenge the orc spellcasters.

## Otyughs

Where garbage lingers, an otyugh lurks. These massive lumps of muscle and maw are scavengers with an insatiable hunger for trash. They plod through refuse on three stout legs, using tooth-lined tentacles to feed on decay. If the stench isn't enough to stop a creature in their tracks, the otyugh's infectious bite certainly will. When starved or if their territory is invaded, otyughs don't hesitate to attack other creatures.

***Trash Adaptive.*** Though an otyugh naturally has three legs, three tentacles, and one eyestalk, they can rapidly transform these appendages to better suit their shifting, chaotic environment. Their tentacles can sprout eyes before plunging into a thick garbage pile or become padded feet to navigate treacherous terrain. The otyugh's adaptable limbs also allow them a flexible response to threats, whether by fleeing on many feet or by growing arms for a hunt.

## Overminds

> [!quote]  
> 
> "Careful, Xorannox," the queen's consort cautioned. "You tread heavily."
> 
> "Tread heavily? My dear consort," the Tyract's grin twisted, "I never touch the ground."

Formally known by their endonym, vaurath (plural vaurathi), overminds plot and scheme against their chief rivals, the synlirii and the olothec, for control of the World Below.

***Psionic Eyes.*** An overmind is an enormous floating brain with a large central eye surrounded by many smaller embedded eyes. Even more alien, several psionic eyes float within inches of their head, each connected to a small brain that can manifest a unique psionic effect.

***Intelligent Loremasters.*** Like their rivals, overminds are loremasters of supreme intellect. They aren't usually wizards, but they all view the collection of knowledge and arcane sciences as the best tool for ultimate conquest. Overminds are cruel and capricious but enjoy tests of intellectual might. Their one vanity is their unshakable belief in their own intellectual superiority over all others.

***Overmind Lairs.*** Thanks to their innate flight, overminds prefer to build (or rather, have their thralls build) towers with no doors or entrances anywhere near the bottom.

***Rivalries and Negotiations.*** Unlike their rivals, overminds have an intense hatred of their own kind and never work together. However, overminds often enjoy diplomacy with other species, seeking to form alliances and build secret networks of agents throughout the World Below.

***Smelly Eggs.*** Overmind procreation involves one aberration laying a single egg in a slime pool and leaving it behind. When another overmind later detects the distinct smell of the egg, they spray their inseminating fluid into the pool. These actions are compelled by biological necessity, a compulsion even the overminds can't ignore.

Unwitting explorers sometimes accidentally abscond with an egg. If unfertilized, its bearer is likely to attract the attention of other overminds and synlirii that use the eggs in genetic experiments to create psionic creatures. If fertilized, the explorer could find themselves as a newly hatched overmind's first victim.

### Xorannox the Tyract

> [!quote]  
> 
> "Xorannox!" Lady Dazran exclaimed.
> 
> "Hahaha! Surprised? You forgot my allies among the drow, I think. You should know better, my lady. Nothing exceeds my Grasp."

Xorannox (ZOR-ah-nocks (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Xorannox.html)) rules as Lord of the White Tower, a multi-level finger of alabaster stone. Commonly known as the Tyract—an ancient Deep Speech word that literally translates as "a king who rules with his teeth"—the overmind indeed consumes those who displease him.

Xorannox is chief of the Grasp, a secret organization made up of deep gnomes, dark elves, and humans. They seek to overthrow the voiceless talkers' great empire and place Xorannox above all, first as king, then as god.

The Tyract is a master strategist, always one step ahead of his enemies. Adventurers from the Mundane World may be surprised to discover their deep allies are members of the Grasp. When they meet Xorannox, he's delighted! He loves treating with humanoids! They have the same enemies, after all.

Unfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies. He assumes, as do most vaurathi, that the natural end of all alliances is betrayal. It's just a matter of who stabs who first.

***Eyes Always Shielded.*** Xorannox's psionic might is so great that unlike other overminds, his floating eyes are never without their psionic shield. When he is truly in distress, Xorannox can sacrifice one of his eyes to bolster his resistances.

## Owlbears

Owlbears possess powerful feathered frames, terrible claws, and a violent distrust of other creatures. The world has come to hate the owlbear, and the owlbear despises the world—a fact they violently express to any creature who crosses their path. Owlbears gain the upper hand by pinning their prey between their powerful appendages and massive form, then they mercilessly rip apart trapped victims with their honed natural weapons.

This behemoth of fur and feathers aggressively patrols their territory. They tend to lead a solitary existence, but during mating season, they den as pairs with their bitter broods.

***Relentless Stalker.*** When the sun hangs low at sunset, the owlbear commits to kill. They wander tirelessly for countless miles in search of prey, regardless of the threat that prey might pose to them. They seek to hunt and kill not merely because of hunger or desire to defend their territory, but because of an overwhelming drive to display physical dominance. After a victory, the owlbear drags their victim back to their territory, feeding on flesh and discarding bones in sloven and draggletailed fashion.

***Ravening Beast of Prey.*** Beyond their wanton killing, these monstrosities quickly upset the local food chain when they settle in an area. As they crowd out other apex predators, this soon leads to an overabundance of vermin. And even when they're not on the hunt, owlbears knock down mature trees with their long claws, collecting the wood into massive piles to harvest termite mounds.

***Fierce Companions.*** Despite the owlbear's vicious tendencies, they're naturally wise and intelligent creatures. Owlbears have shown surprising empathy for the grieving and forsaken outcasts who journey into wild places. Taming an owlbear takes a fearless heart and a commitment rivaling the creature's need to kill.

> [!note] Wild Shape and Owlbears
> 
> Owlbears are awesome. These fluffy, furry, ferocious creatures have captured the hearts of players everywhere. Almost every GM is eventually asked by a player if their character can turn into an owlbear using the [druid](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/classes/druid-xphb.md)'s Wild Shape class feature or the [polymorph](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/polymorph-xphb.md) spell.
> 
> The official answer is no. Owlbears are Monstrosities, not Beasts (despite both owls and bears individually being Beasts), so that automatically disqualifies them as an option for the druid's Wild Shape feature and the polymorph spell. But saying no is denying a player a chance to do a cool thing, and doing cool things is a big part of many people's fun with this game. We want to give you the option of saying yes.

> - The owlbear's Hulking Rush reaction can be used once. The owlbear regains all uses when they finish a long rest.

## Shambling Mounds

The ground, lush and overgrown, squelches under every footstep. Curtains of menacing vines block the way, and muffled groans echo distantly under the darkening canopy. By the time you realize the ground is moving, it's too late—the shambling mound has taken you.

Found in overgrown swamps, stinking marshes, dense wodes, and dark, damp rainforests, the shambling mound is a wandering mass of vegetation that feeds on everything in their path.

***Hearty Eater.*** As a shambling mound drags their massive form through the undergrowth, they consume any organic matter they pass. When they find a good place to lurk until a meal comes to them, the result is far more satisfying. After a mound engulfs their prey—be they animal or adventurer—the meal-to-be is sealed in a sack of interwoven vines and leaves. The walls of this vegetative chamber release a toxic sap that dissolves the prey inside.

***Verdant Camouflage.*** Rather than slowly chase prey, the shambling mound prefers to drape their form along well-traveled paths. They blend perfectly into their hunting ground, making it easy to seize unsuspecting passersby. A shambling mound in a rainforest may sport vines, ferns, and giant leaves, while another in a swamp engulfs adventurers in massive grasses, moss, and reeds.

***Noxious Origins.*** A shambling mound is most often a byproduct of a nearby evil mage. The nefarious magic of the surrounding land can coalesce into a nocuous creature consumed by hunger. The shambling mound knows only that they must feed, and thus they drag themself in search of a hunting ground.

***Growing in Size.*** Most shambling mounds begin their unnatural lives about the size of an adult human. These smaller young are often called shambling piles. The strongest among these piles consume their many siblings, growing much larger and becoming true shambling mounds.

***Will Work for Food.*** Shambling mounds aren't malicious, and some show a capacity for learning. Daring (or foolish) adventurers might find that feeding a shambling mound a steady diet of evildoers turns them into a loyal companion.

## Stirges

A tiny winged insectoid with a long proboscis, the stirge feasts not on blood, but on their prey's very soul. While feeding, a stirge poisons its target, eventually lulling them into a dazed stupor until the insectoid can devour their fill.

***Ill Omens.*** Experienced adventurers know that striges are drawn to areas of foul magic like those found in the lair of a vampire, lich, or evil mage. These fell beings encourage the striges to stay, feeding them prisoners or incompetent underlings.

***Stirge Brood.*** A single stirge is a minor annoyance—but it's rare to find just one. Removing a single soul-sucking stirge from one's body is unpleasant enough, but the true terror lies in wondering how many more remain in the shadows. Stirge nests typically contain several eager young broodlings, and while they lack the potent poison of their parents, broodlings attack in greater numbers.

***Stirge Companions.*** Should an adventurer adopt a stirge and provide plenty of villains to feast on, they'll likely find the little insectoid makes quite a loyal companion.

> [!note] Content Warning: Soul Trauma
> 
> You or your players may find it upsetting to describe a stirge sipping at their victim's soul. If so, you can adjust the description for everyone's enjoyment, making the stirge a creature who pumps venom into their victims instead.

## Time Raiders

The kuran'zoi (coor-AN-zoy (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Kuranzoi.html)), also called time raiders, are humanoids who make the Astral Sea their home. Many kuran'zoi make their living as guides for travelers from other planes, while others survive on the Sea of Stars through piracy of interplanar vessels.

Veterans of the Psychic Wars. Thousands of years ago, the synlirii—a powerful species of evil psionic aberrations—created kuran'zoi as soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented and enhanced these warriors' psionic abilities, the kuran'zoi saw the true nature of their progenitors. They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Astral Sea, becoming nomads of the timescape.

***Hardened-Vision Hexapods.*** Kuran'zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also defend them against the hardlight storms of the Astral Sea, the escaping kuran'zoi chose the Sea of Stars as their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar.

Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran'zoi is like a squad unto themself.

***Psi-Tech.*** Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only their people can activate. Many kuran'zoi specialize in melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of psionic armor that empower their allies.

***Genre Raiders.*** The moniker "time raider" is imprecise. When kuran'zoi raid a world of the timescape—like Orden—that relies on sorcery instead of kuran'zoi technology, it seems to those people as though the time raiders have been to the future and returned with marvelous weapons from worlds where light hits as hard as steel.

***Leave a Few Alive.*** Time raider pirates plunder traveling vessels, allowing just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can make it back home as a warning. Kuran'zoi pirate captains often remind their crews, "Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they'll return with a new coat of wool for us to shear."

Creatures Outside Time. While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other creatures don't age. As a result, many living kuran'zoi recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned from millennia of war into new battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond war; time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their creches secret and protected.

> [!note] But I Want a Blaster!
> 
> Only time raiders can use the psionic weapons they wield in combat. On the other hand, it can be really fun for a player to have their character brandish a blaster, serrated saber, or golden scythe. At your discretion, these martial weapons use the following rules when wielded by a player character.
> 
> ***Blaster.*** The blaster is a ranged weapon that deals `1d6` radiant damage on a hit. Its normal range is 30 feet, and its long range is 90 feet.
> 
> ***Golden Scythe.*** This heavy, two-handed melee weapon deals `2d6` slashing damage on a hit. When you hit with this weapon, you can deal an extra `3d8` necrotic damage. Once you deal this extra necrotic damage, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
> 
> ***Serrated Saber.*** This melee weapon deals `1d8` slashing damage on a hit. As a bonus action, you can charge the serrated saber with psychic energy. The next creature you hit with the weapon before the end of this turn has disadvantage on the next attack roll they make before the start of your next turn.

## Titans

A titan slumbers beneath each of the eight regions of Orden, rousing from their sleep every few millennia—so infrequently, most people view the titans as mere legends. References to these beings of immense form and power appear on the walls of ancient temples and in histories of ancient catastrophes.

The few people who know the titans exist worship them as protectors and defenders against the end of the world. Though the titans of Orden rank among the most powerful creatures in the timescape, no texts even hint at where they came from, or who created them—if they were created. This section describes two titans: Goxomoc (GAUZ-ahmock (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Goxomoc.html)), titan of Ix, and the Kraken, titan of Higara. Some others, like the Phoenix, titan of Phaedros, are known, while the nature of several remains a mystery.

***Defenders of All the World.*** Legends and sages agree that the titans awaken only when their homeland, their people, or the entire world is threatened—but it's unclear what these godlike creatures view as a threat. They certainly don't seem interested in local politics, tyrants, plagues, or natural disasters. In truth, they await an existential threat powerful enough to destroy the world.

***Minds Forever Voyaging.*** The titans' powers combine psionics and elemental magics. Sages believe each titan is associated with a different element: air, earth, fire, water, and beyond.

Though the titans sleep, their dreams affect reality. For millennia, sailors around Higara have reported giant tentacled sea monsters they called krakens; these are obviously not *the* Kraken, but aspects manifested from that titan's dreams.

***Complex Communication.*** Direct communication with most titans is difficult, as mortals rarely register on their awareness. A powerful talent or beastheart might be able to forge a mental link with a titan, but they'd receive only impressions, images, feelings, and abstract ideas.

***Arise, Great Titan! Awake!*** Long-lost rituals could rouse a slumbering titan—though such a supplicant runs a very high risk of failure and death. The people of Ix speak of a time long ago when their priests woke Goxomoc to repulse a synlirii invasion, and they're confident they could rouse their titan again in time of need.

Sages believe that waking a titan for no reason would provoke them into a ruinous march, destroying entire swaths of Orden and wiping out thousands of mortal souls. Evil cultists seeking the destruction of the world agree, and thus they search tirelessly for the ritual to rouse a titan.

### Goxomoc

Goxomoc the Terror Lord slumbers under the great volcano called Ynixquichcauitl (een-eeks-keesh-KAH-hooeetuhl (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Ynixquichcahuitl.html)) which can be translated to "The End of All Things." The Oaxuatl people of Ix believe this volcano's inevitable eruption will signal the end of this world, and they look to it to determine the slumbering titan's mood.

The Oaxuatl respect and revere their protector in his aspects as a being of the earth and of storms. In both ancient and modern Ixian temples, iconography features Goxomoc in many stylized forms. The Oaxuatl do not pray to him, invoke his name, or even believe he is aware of them. But they share an unshakable belief that, should the land be threatened, the Terror Lord shall rouse and defend the land.

***Father of Terror.*** The Oaxuatl people believe Goxomoc created the tetzahuitl, the great terror lizards that dominate their island chain. They consider these "children of Goxomoc" to be sacred avatars of the titan.

***The Lightning Lord.*** Goxomoc relies on powerful and reality-bending psionics to defeat his enemies, but should his corporeal form fail, enemies find themselves face-to-face with Goxomoc's essence, Xogomoc—a giant terror lizard made of living lightning.

### The Kraken

Under the placid rolling waves of the ocean east of Higara, the Kraken—Titan of the Mindstorm—has slumbered restlessly beneath the seafloor for millennia. Many lesser krakens are born of the titan's furtive dreams and disturbed thoughts, rising to prowl the seas as they seek some bane or boon. But scholars are unsure what these Children of the Kraken seek, or what will happen if they complete their quest.

Just as Goxomoc symbolizes the earth and the great volcano that dominates Ix, the Kraken symbolizes the great ocean that provides food and industry for Higara. The ocean provides, and the ocean destroys.

The Kraken resembles a great, tentacled sea dragon, but they are not related to true dragons. Like the other titans, the Kraken's powerful psionics grant them awesome abilities. Their physical form is a unique amalgam of flesh, bone, and solid psionic energy.

***Little-Known Guardian.*** The people of Higara are largely unaware of the existence of their titan. They view the Emperor Naga, who slumbers in the cave beneath the Palace of the Empress, as the defender of their nation and region. It's unknown if any relationship exists between their Father of Serpents and the Titan of the Mindstorm.

Though land-dwellers care little for the Kraken, many fisherfolk make a living on the seas around Higara, following a way of life that has remained largely unchanged for thousands of years. These sailors know the Kraken and his children, and they paint stylized icons of a great sea serpent on their sails and carve kraken imagery into their ships.

## Treants

Trees awakened to consciousness by archdruids, treants care for the forest, nature, and the world as stewards and wardens. A face forms on their upper trunk, and their lower trunk divides into two legs. Vines twirl around the treant's flexible branches, which act as powerful arms that end in claws of sharpened wood.

***Chosen Ones.*** Archdruids can imbue a special sapling with transformative magic, bringing a treant sapling to life. This ritual is no ordinary plant awakening, and the saplings are carefully chosen for their appreciation of the natural beauty of the world and their desire to nurture it. Occasionally, an awakened sapling survives for thousands of years—often by retreating into the depths of an ancient forest—and grows to become a true treant. Most treants hold fast to their passion for nature and swear to defend the forest that allowed them to grow old and strong.

***Ripple Awakenings.*** Though the first treants were created by archdruids, an ancient treant can themself create new treants by bonding with a tree for a decade, then awakening the plant. The more ancient and undisturbed a forest, the more likely it holds a grove of treants ready to defend the land.

***Nature's Guardians.*** Treants are profoundly attuned to nature and their home forest. Many treant groves guard special areas, such as a druid's grove or a source of primal magic. These staunch protectors don't hesitate to confront questionable travelers, and they're likely to attack those who act recklessly toward the forest. Violence is rarely a treant's first course of action, but they have no interest in negotiating with anyone they deem untrustworthy. A provoked treant offers a single stern warning, which only the most foolish intruders ignore. When enemies inevitably flee, the treant rarely gives chase outside the bounds of their woods, satisfied they have defended their charge.

***One with the Forest.*** The magic within treants touches the webs of magic connecting their forest, allowing them to call forth vines and heal allies. Their roots sense the vibrations of nearby creatures. Treants can speak with both plants and animals, many of whom who act as their scouts.

***Treant Arrows.*** When another creatures risks their life for the forest standing side by side with a treant, the plant rewards the bravery by giving them one or more treant arrows.

## Trolls

The embodiment of carnivorous hunger, trolls rampage through the wild, leaving destruction in their wake. Tall and gangly, their mottled green skin is covered by a mane of matted hair that runs around their neck and down their back. In many ways, they resemble massive humanoids, but their exaggerated features belie this comparison; their lower jaw hangs unhinged and distended, and their long arms end in claws which drag along the ground as they walk.

***Hypermetabolism.*** A troll's constant hunger and aggression begets a life of violence. Like a grotesque miracle, they quickly assimilate consumed flesh into themselves to regenerate their body. Some scholars think this extreme metabolic process is the source of their hunger, but none know for certain which came first.

***Phases of Destruction.*** Fortunately for the ecosystems they inhabit, trolls can't be active all the time. Their natural behavior is to hunt relentlessly for a few days, then return to their dens to rest for as much as a week. Patient troll hunters can wait for this hibernation and catch the trolls by surprise—though the cost of waiting can be high, thanks to the damage the trolls might do in the meantime.

***Strange Mutations.*** Though a troll's preferred prey are humanoids and beasts, stories circulate of them feeding on undead, aberrations, and even celestials, assimilating their flesh to magnificent and horrifying effect.

***Limbjumbles.*** When a suitably large piece of mutated troll is torn off in battle, it does its very best to keep on living. Mutation and deep-seated survival instinct go into overdrive, sprouting unthinkable assortments of malformed arms and legs. Though these limbjumbles are ultimately short-lived, they can often be found tumbling awkwardly behind living trolls.

> [!note] Mutated Trolls
> 
> At the GM's discretion, a troll can mutate after consuming the flesh of an alien, powerful, or supernaturally created creature, gaining some of their prey's damage immunities and resistances, traits, or actions. For instance, a troll who devours a blue dragon might gain the creature's immunity to lightning damage and Lightning Breath action. Be aware this can significantly increase the difficulty trolls present in combat—especially if their mutations deal more damage than normal or grant immunity to acid or fire damage.

## Undead

Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something other than a mortal. No matter the reason for their creation, all undead were once living creatures who walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.

***Stuff of Nightmares.*** Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people's fear of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.

Given all the murder and anguish that has occurred at the rotting hands of the undead, their wicked reputation is well earned. But there are some honorable and kind mages who practice necromancy. They see the often-taboo school of magic as a tool that helps preserve resources and could be the key to unlocking eternal life.

***Dark Places.*** For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While it is rarely harmful to them, the sun's golden rays make them uncomfortable and seems to shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for the fearful eyes of mortals to spot an undead. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can better stalk their victims.

***Encountered Together.*** Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and wights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. Because undead don't need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe and many share an affinity for lightless places, they often gather together.

> [!note] Undead in One Section
> 
> This book presents a lot of the Undead creatures together in one section because most GMs tend to use ghouls, skeletons, vampires, zombies, and the like together in the same encounters. By keeping these Undead together, it makes for less page flipping or PDF scrolling for the GM when running an encounter.

### Incorporeal Undead

> [!quote] A quote from Racaar, Mystic Theurge of the Restless Order  
> 
> These aren't your regular ghosts. They cling to this world, determined to take as many of the living with them as possible before they're destroyed.

Shadows. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be formed by a person's vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer's dark art. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, spectral undead are malice incarnate.

***What They Can't Have.*** All spectral undead yearn for something only the living can provide. Specters and their lesser kindred, shades, vaguely remember their lives—and they're murderously envious of those who haven't lost theirs. Shadows want to drain living things of physical warmth and vitality (and the less tainted by evil their quarry is, the better). Meanwhile, wraiths greedily devour the living to taste their life essence.

***Drawn to the Living.*** Spectral undead who naturally formed from the souls of malicious, hate-filled humanoids usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being serve their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to slaughter living creatures they encounter. Some even leave the places they haunt to stalk their quarry over miles of wilderness.

#### Kiona the Dread Lord

Once a humble historian and archaeologist, Kiona Duemois stumbled across the Codex Mortis, a powerful tome of necromancy, in her travels. It changed her life forever—and ended it.

She spent months poring over her discovery, attempting to decipher the book's archaic passages. At first, she only meant to study the tome and record notes on her findings . . . but the codex called to her. Enthralled, Kiona convinced herself that she should just perform one of the book's smaller incantations for posterity. That one spell destroyed her earthly form and turned her ragged soul into a twisted, shadowy abomination of dark power.

The Codex Mortis mysteriously disappeared shortly after Kiona's death. In her new form, she set out to amass more power. The once genial archaeologist thirsts for the life of the living and yearns to hold the Codex Mortis once more. To those ends, she has built an army of spectral undead who carry out her every desire.

You can find out more about the Codex Mortis in "Strongholds & Followers".

### Lesser Corporeal Undead

At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, wights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Most lack a soul, and many can't think beyond the orders of their creators (unlike more powerful corporeal undead, such as liches and vampires). Those who aren't controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.

***Halted Processes.*** The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. These spells also halt decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration when magic touched them. Some experienced necromancers can even reverse a corpse's decay, making an undead appear living at a glance.

***Eternal Service.*** Most corporeal undead are created and controlled by a mage. Some guard libraries, laboratories, or treasures, while others perform menial labor. But the truly fearful undead are the soldiers in rotted armies, ready to conquer for their creator. These warriors never tire or complain. They have no need for food or drink. They exist only to lay waste.

When their mortal creators die, the undead unceasingly carry out their last orders. Some guard ruined towers for eternity while others search forests for long-escaped quarry. Should these final orders ever be fulfilled, most undead without a commander resort to killing any mortals they come across.

***Deriding Awareness.*** Some corporeal undead, such as ghouls and wights, come to being with awareness and full autonomy, even if the undead is at the command of another. However, these undead typically retain no memory or personality from their mortal life, and they act on desires instilled in them from their creator.

***Unique Risings.*** While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, there are tales of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astrological occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy. Some sages theorize that any place tainted with abundant evil could gradually animate a corpse with foul magic.

#### Crawling Claw

Crawling claws are severed hands animated by fell spells. The magic that granted them unlife also turns their fingernails into filth-covered blades. These tiny creatures are wickedly mischievous and make rude gestures at their opponents before attacking.

#### Ghoul

Though they don't require food to exist, ghouls endlessly hunger for mortal flesh. When a ghoul comes into being, their limbs and tongue grow longer, each ending in jagged claws and barbs. Negative energy courses through these weapons, allowing the ghoul to slow their prey and tear flesh from bones.

#### Skeleton

Without flesh to weigh them down, skeletons are among the most agile undead. This unnatural talent makes them prized archers in most necromancers' armies—doubly so because skeletons can use their remains as ammunition infused with necrotic energy, then regrow these expended bones the next day.

#### Wight

The most competent of the lesser corporeal undead, the sallow-skinned, red-eyed wights often protect necromancers in battle and issue orders to other undead. When given a general order (such as "destroy the farmlands"), they can make and execute a plan to achieve it. On top of their cunning, a wight's mere touch can drain a mortal's vitality.

#### Zombie

The most numerous of the corporeal undead, zombies are slow, mindless corpses who are tough to kill. They require very little magic to create, so even budding necromancers usually have a few zombie bodyguards, and zombies often fill the ranks of undead armies. Powerful necromancers wield enough magic to control much bigger corpses, reanimating giants into enormous war engines.

### Liches

A lich begins life as a mortal, often a wizard or sorcerer, fueled by a burning, unquenchable hunger for knowledge at any cost. Knowledge beyond life and death, beyond this world, beyond gods and fiends. Possesed by the unshakable belief that ultimate knowledge brings ultimate power. The necessary rites are forbidden in many cultures, for they require a bloody, evil act: the sacrifice of someone dear to the would-be lich.

***Forging Soulstones.*** The ritual to create a lich requires a sphere constructed of something personal to the subject, such as steel from an heirloom suit of armor or a tangle of branches from the tree that shaded their wedding. To complete the rite, the subject must rip out their own heart and the heart of a living loved one, placing both inside the sphere. The hearts conjoin and transmute into a ruby that welds to the sphere, creating the new lich's soulstone.

As long as their soulstone remains intact, a lich can never truly die. Most soulstones are small and easy to conceal, though a lich can construct the stone's outer sphere to be any size that suits their purpose.

***Terrifying Presence.*** A lich's true appearance is ghastly. The damage to their chest never heals, and over the centuries, their body slowly decays into a skeleton. Some liches hide their appearance with an illusion that makes them even more attractive and vivacious than they were in life. Others embrace their terrifying look, proudly displaying their dark triumph to every creature they encounter.

***Immortality Is Not Enough.*** Though all liches desire eternal life, it fails to satisfy most. These powerful former adventurers seek more of everything they've always craved—more glory, more power, more wealth. Most set about amassing all three, building armies of followers to seize whatever the lich desires from any who resist their charm.

***Lich Lairs.*** Liches are strongest when surrounded by devoted followers. Their lairs can be found inside strongholds, castles, government halls, or any place of power.

***Threats Demolished.*** Liches know the power of do-gooding adventurers who could threaten their pursuits and soulstone, and they seek to remain keenly aware of such threats. Adventurers with a treasure trove of powerful items or the potential strength to resist a lich are hunted mercilessly.

> [!note] Soulstone Rejuvenation
> 
> Most characters don't go up against a lich unprepared. By the time they face the villain in a final confrontation, characters (and their players) should understand how the lich's soulstone and Rejuvenation trait work. Since the soulstone can easily bring a lich back to life once the lich's soul is inside, the party's best shot at defeating them once and for all is to destroy the stone first, then kick some lich butt.

#### High Mage Vairae

Vairae (veh-RYE (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Vairae.html)) came from a long line of elf mages in Gael Wode. They excelled at school and easily made friends—which meant no one challenged them when they bullied the weaker children.

As an adult, Vairae joined the Gael garrison as a battle mage to round out their skills. Again they performed admirably and were showered with admirers and promotions. But after discovering a cryptic tome on the corpse of an enemy wizard, Vairae set their sights even higher—for the tome contained a ritual to keep their vigor and power forever. After many late nights spent deciphering the text, Vairae succumbed to the irresistible pull to complete this ritual . . . and sacrificed their best friend in the process.

Their heart now sealed in a sphere of everlasting ice, Vairae returned to Gael Wode in disguise and ambitiously rose to the rank of High Mage. Today, the centuries-old Vairae is as spry and handsome as ever, with loyal followers at their command. But the world outside the wode is large and doesn't belong to Vairae—yet.

### Mournlings

> [!note] Content Warning: Body Horror
> 
> Flesh mournlings are conglomerations of many different creatures sewn together. If you or your players don't want such descriptions in your game, these mournlings could instead be made from plants or other natural material.
^content-warning-body-horror

Powered by sorrow and rage, these animated conglomerations of dirt or flesh defend the homes of their creators, brutally attacking intruders while sobbing uncontrollably. Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss.

***Druidic Origins.*** Ages ago, a sect of druids came together to solve the endless exploitation and destruction of the natural world caused by humanoid expansion. How could the druids ever hope to combat such reckless waste—the logging of entire forests, the animals hunted to extinction, the mass destruction of war? Desperate, the druids invoked forbidden rites, forming bodies from the detritus of humanoid disasters and infusing them with necrotic energy. Flesh, dirt, and the souls of creatures lost to destruction combined with the druid's sorrow to become the first mournlings.

***Grieving Guardians.*** Though their creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, meadows, and other natural places they were built to protect. When expansion threatens a druid circle's corner of the world, the druids revive the ancient ritual and create new mournlings. Though the ritual is little-known outside of the most ancient druid sects, dedicated or lucky mages and clerics could uncover the rites and use them to create protectors for their towers and temples.

***Violence from Sorrow.*** Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then they burst into violence. They continue to sob and moan even as they viciously beat their enemies to a pulp.

Animal and Plant Protectors. Mournlings never intentionally harm an animal or plant creature, unless such a creature harms them first. During each mournling's creation, this compassion for nature is infused into their being—alongside the ever-present sorrow.

> [!note] Making a Mournling
> 
> If player characters wish to create a mournling to protect a wild habitat from destruction, they'll need to learn the secret creation rites—ones known only to the most secluded druid circles. The characters must journey to the home of one of these remote sects without harming the natural world. To characters who pass this first test, the druids offer a quest to prove the party's loyalty and love to nature. This quest usually involves battling those who seek to corrupt or harm the creatures of the wild.
^making-a-mournling

#### Dirt Mournling

Dirt mournlings are guardians made of packed earth who leave a trail of silt or clay wherever they walk. A steady stream of tears constantly moistens the mournling's soil and makes them ooze mud.

The soil used to create a dirt mournling must come from a land razed by humanoid-made disaster. During each dirt mournling's creation ritual, their maker gives their soil a certain shape, typically that of an animal or humanoid. The mournling maintains this general form throughout their existence, though they can produce extra limbs during combat to grapple as many foes as they like.

#### Flesh Mournling

A flesh mournling is formed from different pieces of beasts, humanoids, and other creatures. The mournling's creators gather these body parts from creatures who were victims of humanoid expansion, carefully sewing them into what becomes the mournling's functional but grotesque form. No two flesh mournlings have exactly the same arrangement of body parts—some have multiple heads, while others have arms growing from long necks or feet protruding from mismatched shoulders.

### Mummies

Mummies are humanoids raised from the dead via a complex series of magical rituals. The process tethers a creature's soul to their earthly body, preventing them from crossing into true death.

***Complex Ritual.*** Preventing a soul from finding eternal peace requires extraordinary magical effort. As part of the mummification process, a corpse is embalmed and wrapped in cloth imbued with necromantic power. While different cultures practice various embalming methods, all result in a desiccated version of the body encased in a protective, flexible casing.

***Guardians, Prisoners, and Power.*** Mummification is reserved for situations of grave import. A great hero may voluntarily be mummified upon death to eternally guard future generations or a holy relic. On the other hand, a great villain may be mummified to prevent them from escaping their crimes through death. Still others with means become mummies for one simple reason: to live forever.

***Secrets of the Beyond.*** Existing in a realm between life and death grants mummies insight into the universe's great mysteries—and imbues them with unique power over living souls. When a mummy awakens to defend themself or their charge, they can use these powers to hamper foes with potent debilitating curses.

#### Ashyra, Keeper of the Crypt

Ashyra (ah-SHEE-rah (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Ashyra.html)) is the last survivor of an ancient people long passed from the world. Though traces of her civilization have disappeared from the surface, she still carries out her duty, guarding a subterranean necropolis where the remains of one hundred sorcerer-sovereigns rest in eternal slumber.

In her human life, Ashyra led a mystery cult dedicated to unlocking the secrets of immortality. She uncovered the ritual of mummification and performed it on herself just as her people were overthrown. In undeath, Ashyra works slowly and patiently, gathering the knowledge and supplies needed to return the sorcerer-sovereigns from the dead so her people may take back the world that was once theirs.

***City of the Dead.*** For now, Ashyra is cut off from the world above by powerful seals placed on the expansive necropolis she is bound to guard. She knows it is only a matter of time before she exhausts the knowledge within the magical tomes buried with her, so she eagerly waits for an opportunity to escape. Though Ashyra will do everything possible to protect her charges, she knows her people's glorious vision cannot come to pass unless she gains access to the world above.

Ashyra's lair is an underground tower full of books, scrolls, and arcane equipment. This tower guards the entrance to the chamber of the slumbering sorcerer-sovereigns.

### Vampires

> [!quote] A quote from Lydia Lockwood, Occultist  
> 
> They look like us. Sometimes they even act like us. But they are not like us.

Vampirism is a curse of blood. A curse that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life. They become beings of pure vitality that nonetheless hunger for life's essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims. Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their mortal forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves.

***Vampire Spawn.*** A vampire's power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and by their master's orders. Thanks to adventurers and zealous priests, few vampire spawn survive long enough to become true vampires.

***True Vampire.*** After about a hundred years of undeath, a spawn grows in strength and intelligence, becoming a true vampire. They learn to control their thirst and earn new gifts, allowing them to turn their victims into vampire spawn and to charm humanoids. These benefits let the vampire blend into humanoid society, often by masquerading as a long-lost relative of their old family or taking up their former profession. Meanwhile, they carefully choose prey and build a protective army of spawn and thralls.

***Vampire Lord.*** Most vampire lords have spent more than three hundred years in undeath. Some are created through powerful magic. Most have been so corrupted by their curse that they have no moral code and stop at nothing to get what they want. After centuries of amassing resources, vampire lords have the power to achieve nearly any goal. Some build empires. Others seek godhood. A few lie dormant, buried in sarcophagi while the ages flow past, waiting to awaken in new worlds ripe for the plucking.

***Strengths and Weaknesses.*** Though most vampires shun sunlight, some know a secret ritual to counteract this weakness. Vampires don't require food, water, or air, but their bodies become desiccated husks if they don't regularly drink the blood of living beings. Each vampire has a special resting place, typically a coffin or similar vessel, where they can regenerate after an arduous battle. While thus recuperating, they can't move.

***Vampire Thralls.*** True vampires and vampire lords can cast [geas](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/geas-xphb.md), which charms other creatures to do the vampire's bidding. Vampires use this spell to charm creatures in positions of authority. Most have at least one or two thralls working in local governments, which allows the vampire to prey on the populace without any interference from law enforcement or military.

Though magic makes reliable thralls, vampires also rely on promises and coercion to maintain a reliable feeding ground and enact sinister plots. Some humanoids are so desperate for power that they will kill for a vampire in exchange for a promise of being turned into one of the undead someday. Vampires also rely on their servants and supernatural abilities to uncover the crimes and misconduct of mortals in power. Those secrets are used to blackmail people into doing a vampire's bidding.

Whenever a servant disobeys a vampire, swift retribution comes in the form of teeth to the neck. At least they can serve as a drink. There is always another who can take the thrall's place.

***Exsanguinating Weapons.*** Vampire lords can summon exsanguinating weapons made from the blood of their enemies. Only they can wield these weapons, and when a vampire is destroyed, their exsanguinating weapons disappear. The most infamous of these weapons is Sanguinus, the sword of Count Rhodar von Glauer.

***Blood-Starved Vampires.*** When a vampire goes without blood for a year or more, their body shrivels, becoming a living husk. The vampire's thirst for blood becomes their singular focus as their weakened form craves it. These blood-starved vampires often band together for survival, since a single blow can turn one to dust. A blood-starved vampire must drink the blood of scores of humanoids to be restored to an unweakened state.

#### Vampire Lairs

Vampire spawn hide anywhere they can avoid the sun, such as tombs, sewers, or cellars. True vampires build more lavish lairs—opulent manors, shadowed castles, and vast crypts spiraling beneath the earth. Vampire lords lair in blackened towers, hollowed moons, and private demiplanes where the light of day never reaches.

#### Count Rhodar von Glauer

> [!quote] A quote from Motto of House von Glauer  
> 
> I do the devil's work.

After falling to a vampiric curse in his early twenties, Count Rhodar—the last Lord of Glauer—ruled his tiny, heavily forested mountainous county in eastern Rhöl for three hundred years. There were worse overlords, the people said. After all, Rhodar took his pact with the people and the land seriously. He aggressively defended the villages in his demesne against constant incursions from rival counts and barons. He believed his power waxed and waned with the prosperity of the people and the vitality of the land.

Each new moon, when the Red Tax came due, the count would visit a young candidate, then emerge with renewed vitality. Across the land, folk feared their Dragon Count, but the witches of the wood wove a prophecy: "The land's darkest hour shall be the redemption of House von Glauer."

Eventually, the conquering force of Emperor Gaius VIII came for Rhodar—not because he was a vampire, but because the empire wanted his land and people. Count von Glauer was staked, and his body burned to ash. The emperor kept the Rod of Count Rhodar von Glauer as a trophy, and with this symbol of authority, he sealed his claim to the land.

Under new rule, Rhodar's people lament the absence of their lord, recalling the time before the coming of the empire as a golden age. But the witches' whispers can still be heard. For as long as the people of Glauer persist, they continue believing their Dragon Count will return in their darkest hour to deliver them from tyranny.

> [!note] Atypical Vampire Diet
> 
> Vampires thirst for the blood of the living, but not all feast upon innocent sapient creatures. Some live off the blood of animals, though most vampires, including the ones who practice drinking from animals, find the taste of beast blood disgusting. These vampires hold their proverbial noses and gulp the animal blood down, because to them the alternative is unconscionable.
> 
> Other vampires indulge their bloodthirst by drinking from the wicked. These undead become vigilantes or adventurers, hunting the corrupt in search of a meal. Some are venerated by their communities as heroes while others keep their undead nature a secret, revealing it only when they drink from the neck of an adversary.

> [!note] Excerpt from the Chronicle of the Chain of Acheron
> 
> "In those days the Chain was in service to the Emperor Gaius VIII, third of the Five Crusading Emperors, and 27th Emperor of Caelia. Gaius continued the crusades started by his illustrious granduncle. Those were profitable days for the Chain, the Wheel, and the Gate. While the other Helltroopers waded into the deserts of Khoursir and Khemhara, we battled in the forests of Vaslor. We had it easy. I hate deserts.
> 
> "Thinking his vampiric power would save him, Count Rhodar von Glauer waited until he was fulsome in his strength before trying to extend his dark realm into Caelian territory. But we know how to deal with vampires. The black and gold standard of the von Glauer family reads, "I do the devil's work." We can attest to that. We lost many souls to that long siege, but in the end, we staked him. An old woman howled at us saying, "He is the land!" but we hear that stuff all the time. We sacked his castle, burned his forest and orchards, and delivered his staff to the emperor. That was harder than it sounds. Finger had to drop it in one of his bottomless sacks to stop the mists from coming. What the emperor will do with it, I don't know. I fear that staff may hold more than the power to make the mist."

## Valok

Steel dwarves, the greatest artisans of the Mundane World, built valok from rare ores buried deep in the earth. Though these dwarves have disappeared, their incredible constructs remain. No other blacksmith, inventor, or mage has created anything like these magnificent machines.

***Rare Metal Body.*** Steel dwarves unlocked the secrets of smithing valiar—the truemetal—prized not only for its strength and flexibility, but for its entrancing silverywhite beauty. They could turn valiar into anything, from breathtaking weapons and exquisite buildings to hypnotic gossamer fabrics that are nearly transparent and virtually indestructible. The secrets of working with the truemetal disappeared with the dwarves, but not before they built the nigh-invulnerable bodies of the valok.

***Prismacore Power.*** The steel dwarves also mined iridoss, commonly known as prismacore. This rare gemstone was infused with the power of other worlds. Unlike other constructs who are powered by spells or prayer, each valok's prismacore heart allows them to operate without magic. Since prismacore never loses power, valok can work ceaselessly, without rest or respite.

***Mechanized Evolution.*** The first valok were great machines made to dig, smelt, and build. Legends say these giant walkers could build entire cities in a matter of days and could even construct other valok. As the steel dwarves learned the deep secrets of prismacore, they made machines that could speak and think more freely.

While two classes of valok—servok and multivok—have been discovered, ancient steel dwarf carvings hint that a highly advanced third class was created just before the makers disappeared.

***Ancient and Deep.*** Ruined valok litter the deepest ruins of the steel dwarves, and without the secrets of the steel dwarves, their valiar and iridoss are useless to modern smiths. But some valok still labor in the depths, carrying out their final orders and ready to end any who interfere.

### Servok

Servoks, the labor and siege class of valok, are huge, slow, and built for a specific purpose—though all are designed to defend themselves when threatened. No humaniform servoks have been discovered; their forms depend on their purpose, but they're never smaller than a wagon. Despite each servok's utilitarian construction and the ages of grime accumulated atop their iridoss, each servok is impressive to behold.

The dead language of the steel dwarves is lost to time and beyond the reach of most magic, but scholars believe that someone who spoke this ancient tongue could command a servok. Even then, servoks can't act outside their design parameters—a servok designed to mine ore can't be commanded to make a vase.

***Servok Builder.*** Steel dwarves used one class of servoks, called builders, to construct buildings, roads, and walls. Their valiar arms can lift and fling enormous stones, and a great mixing cannister on their back holds concrete that can be spewed forth from an opening at the front of the construct. The steel dwarves equipped each builder with a valiar wrecking ball to demolish any old construction impeding the servok's progress.

Some active builders still work the caverns where they were left, clearing the ground in preparation for some grand project known only to their progenitors.

***Servok Miner.*** Servok miners dug the legendary tunnels of the steel dwarves. These track-driven constructs are equipped with a mechanical drill and pneumatic pick to break through stone with ease. A conveyor belt at the front of the valok allows them to load ore for transport or unload debris in a violent spray.

A few miners still dig tunnels deep into the earth, searching for ore and ready to destroy anything in the way of their search.

***Servok War Engine.*** The quaking of earth and boom of an arcane cannon precedes the arrival of a servok war engine. Built to roll through enemy ranks with their bladed rake, the war engine can also eliminate targets from afar with their massive gun that shoots both magic blasts and burning oil.

There are still war engines that went to battle and haven't returned. They consider every creature they meet who isn't a steel dwarf to be an enemy

### Multivok

Smaller than servoks, multivoks can speak and carry out commands, though their capacity for complexity is limited. While multivoks are humaniform, their masterfully crafted bodies lack the expression and fine articulation of humanoids. They were built to run and maintain ships and ore harvesters, survey dangerous or distant locations, guard nobles, and oversee servoks—tasks which many multivoks tirelessly attempt to continue today.

***Multivok Bodyguard.*** With arms ending in axe blades and repeating crossbows mounted on their shoulders, a multivok bodyguard cuts an impressive figure. They can activate a magnetic power to yank armored targets toward them and away from their charges.

Multivok bodyguards that are still active are typically guarding the bones or possessions of their long-dead charge with unfaltering loyalty.

***Multivok Chief.*** One of the most advanced multivoks, a chief directs and coordinates other valok to get work done. They were built to oversee projects in the absence of steel dwarf supervisors. Each chief wields a targeting beam that allows them to direct other valok toward enemies and objects that require destruction.

Active chiefs still roam the halls of the steel dwarves, organizing their fellow constructs to protect treasures, construct buildings, destroy invaders, and dig tunnels.

## Voiceless Talkers

Among the most powerful psions in the timescape, synlirii (singular: synliroi) are known as the "voiceless talkers" to the denizens of the World Below—and to surface dwellers unfortunate enough to encounter them. Descended from boneless aquatic cephalopods, they are alien in thought and motivation to the humanoid species they loathe. Synlirii consider the "barking ones" (their label for creatures who squeeze air through meat flaps to communicate) to be an abomination that must be corrected.

***Uneasy Alliances.*** Though synlirii and overminds are hereditary enemies, their mutual obsession with the barking ones often leads to uneasy alliances. Both synlirii and overminds employ humanoids from the World Below as agents, trading lore and technology for information on their surface foes.

***Olothec Hatred.*** The synlirii's visceral antipathy toward the barking ones is surpassed only by their deep enmity toward (and fear of) olothec. Ancient myths say olothec created both synlirii and overminds. To overminds, this is a harmless fable. But synlirii, who style themselves as the future masters of the timescape, rage against implications that their powers come from any source other than their own superior development.

***Psionic Spies.*** Despite their mental powers, voiceless talkers consider information their greatest weapon. They use their psionic talents to manipulate memory and perception, obscure their forms, and pass undetected among other cultures.

***Psi-Tech.*** Synlirii breed mollusks that secrete plastic-like substances, using them to fashion weapons and similar technology powered by psionic crystals. The voiceless talkers' handheld psi-pistols and portable psi-rifles can be used only by their alien minds.

***Creature Engineers.*** Synlirii are obsessed with manipulating the natural development of other organisms. They create hulking brains, mindkillers, and other servants using a psionic technique they call the Interlace. Many synlirii experiments don't live long and aren't intended to. But the World Below is littered with unnatural creatures who escaped the voiceless talkers' body banks—most of them singular life forms that can't reproduce and may never die.

***Graywarpers.*** Graywarpers are voiceless talkers who were drained of most of their psionic abilities—and free will—as punishment for insolence or incompetence. They are viewed solely as expendable tools who enhance the power of other voiceless talkers.

> [!note] Absolute Evil
> 
> Voiceless talkers are evil sapient beings who engage in reprehensible and irredeemable acts of eugenics. While you can create exceptional synlirii who fight against such philosophies and practices, the voiceless talkers who participate in genetic experiments are unquestionably evil.
^absolute-evil

### Hulking Brain

The voiceless talkers have engineered pearlescent-skinned, humanoid-shaped aberrations with four massive arms and—in place of a head—a large pulsing brain. Called thylinça by voiceless talkers and hulking brains by everyone else, these creatures serve as bodyguards and psionic batteries for their synlirii creators.

### Mindkiller

Floating clawed brains with a trailing spinal column and nerves, mindkillers serve as the voiceless talkers' pets and lackeys. These amorphous parasites can force themselves into a humanoid's body through the ear, eye, or nose, then devour the victim's central nervous system while replacing it with their own tissue. When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim's knowledge and memories and can puppet the body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller's synlirii overlords.

Mindkiller whelps are a lesser form of mindkiller that can be created in a fraction of the time. While they can't inhabit bodies, their mere presence weakens their foes' mental defenses against psionics.

### Lord Syuul

Chief Design Architect of his nation's body banks, the synliroi Lord Syuul (see-YOU-ull (https://mcdm.gg/FleeMortals/Syull.html)) seeks more material for his experiments. His spies, informants, and allies are always on the lookout for subjects with unique hereditary traits the Interlace might extract.

Lord Syuul, who belongs to an ancient and respected noble house, never leaves his estate without a retinue of guards and minions. They obey his orders fanatically—as Syuul has ensured they're biologically incapable of refusing to do so.

Syuul's recent experiments have focused on isolating the trait that expresses sorcerous ability in humanoids. Thus far, these attempts have been unsuccessful. Not to be deterred, Lord Syuul has placed his assistant in charge of the day-to-day operations of the body banks, while Syuul himself ventures forth to observe the surface world and plunder its diversity.

> [!note] Psi-Tech
> 
> While most psi-tech weapons can be used only by voiceless talkers, a character using the talent class (from the MCDM supplement The Talent and Psionics (https://mcdm.gg/talent)) can use these weapons by gaining 1 strain each time they make an attack with one. A creature using a psi-tech ranged weapon uses Intelligence instead of Dexterity for attack and damage rolls.

## Wyverns

Dragons can be poor hosts, but at least they can be reasoned with. Wyverns, on the other hand, have the ferocity of dragons without their intelligence or ego. Their aggression is driven by hunting and territorial instinct. Many adventurers meet their end in the wyvern's maw—some because the wyvern saw them as competitors, and others because the wyvern was simply hungry.

Wyvern scales match the colors of the mud, rock, and rust that dominate the mountains and badlands where they prefer to reside. Unlike true dragons, wyverns don't have front legs—instead, they walk like bats, propelled by their rear legs and balancing on the joints of their wings.

***Mountain Hunters.*** While on the hunt, wyverns perch on stone outcroppings and natural spires overlooking their territory. They first attack with their stinger, injecting prey with corrosive acid. If a wyvern's victim attempts to hide, the wyvern's hooked claws and fearsome teeth can tear open any crag or crevice in pursuit.

***Acidic Aggressors.*** Without front limbs to grasp their prey, wyverns prefer to keep their distance and strike with their long, stinger-tipped tails. A single sting is usually enough to kill common game outright, and even larger foes are left wracked by pain. Wyverns have no interest in a drawn-out struggle, and they relentlessly sting their foes at every opportunity.

***Protective Parents.*** A wyvern's infamous temper is easily provoked, particularly if their eggs or hatchlings are threatened. Many monster slayers for hire won't accept contracts to track and hunt wyverns during hatching season. Yet this season is when heroes are needed most, as mated pairs aggressively hunt anything or anyone to feed their young.
