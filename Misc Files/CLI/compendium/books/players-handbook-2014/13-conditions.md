# Conditions
*Source: Player's Handbook (2014), p. 289* 

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), are impairments, but a few, such as [invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible), can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

For a full list of the conditions, see the conditions page. The conditions are:- [blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded)  - [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)  - [deafened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened)  - [exhaustion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion)  - [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)  - [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)  - [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)  - [invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible)  - [paralyzed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed)  - [petrified](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified)  - [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)  - [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)  - [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)  - [stunned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned)  - [unconscious](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious)
