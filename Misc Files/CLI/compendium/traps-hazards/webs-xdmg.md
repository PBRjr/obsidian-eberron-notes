# Webs
*Generic Hazard*  

Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled areas are [Difficult Terrain](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md).

A creature that enters a web-filled area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or have the [Restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. As an action, a creature Restrained by the webs can try to escape from them, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check.

Each 10-foot [Cube](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of webs has AC 10; HP 15; Vulnerability to Fire damage; and Immunity to Piercing, Poison, and Psychic damage.
