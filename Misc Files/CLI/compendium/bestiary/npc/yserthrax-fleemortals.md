    \ spell, or similar supernatural effect.\n\nWhile corrupted, a creature takes\
    \ 14 (4d6) psychic damage at the start of each of their turns as their mind\
    \ and body are ravaged by reality-warping anomalies. If a creature dies while\
    \ corrupted, their body melts into a gruesome puddle, becoming a [gibbering mouther](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther-fleemortals.md)\

- "desc": "Yserthrax exhales poison in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area\

- "desc": "Yserthrax conjures three monoliths of otherworldly green crystal, which\
    \ grow out of the ground centered on three points she can see within 500 feet\
    \ of her. Each monolith is a 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder with AC 19,\

    \ block Yserthrax's vision. Each creature within 10 feet of a monolith other than\
    \ Yserthrax is vulnerable to psychic damage. When a monolith is destroyed, each\
