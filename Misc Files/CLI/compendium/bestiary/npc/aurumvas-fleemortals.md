    \ and adds 1 to his soul count. A creature whose soul is consumed in this way\

    \ that aren't artifacts or of legendary rarity and that don't require attunement.\
    \ He teleports each item to an ally who he can see within 30 feet of him, placing\
    \ it either into their hands or at their feet. If a targeted object is being worn\
