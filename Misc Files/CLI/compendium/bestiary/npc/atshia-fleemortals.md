"traits":
- "desc": "When Atæshia fails a saving throw, a willing creature within 60 feet of\
    \ her who can see her can give their life to protect her. This creature dies instantly,\
    \ and Atæshia succeeds on the saving throw."
  "name": "Offer to Remembrance (3/Day)"
- "desc": "When Atæshia is reduced to 0 hit points, she disintegrates into ash on\
    \ a solemn wind. For the next 100 years, if a Celestial, a Elemental, or a Humanoid\
    \ whose challenge rating or level is 5 or higher dies within 60 feet of where\
    \ Atæshia died, Atæshia returns to life where she died with 25 hit points."
  "name": "Reborn From War"
"actions":
- "desc": "Atæshia makes three Pale Flame attacks. She can replace one attack with\
    \ a use of Moment of Loss, if available."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120\
    \ ft., one target. Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) radiant damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.\
    \ If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, they die and all their remains\
    \ burn to nothing."
  "name": "Pale Flame"
- "desc": "Atæshia transforms one creature she can see within 60 feet of her into\
    \ the form of a living ash cloud. While transformed to ash, the target is immune\
    \ to all damage, can't provide cover to other creatures, and can't take reactions.\
    \ At the start of the target's next turn, they reform and must make a DC 21 Constitution\
    \ saving throw. On a failed save, the target is reduced to 1 hit point. On a successful\
    \ save, the target takes 44 (8d10) necrotic damage. This damage can't reduce\
    \ the target's hit points below 1."
  "name": "Moment of Loss (Recharge 6)"
- "desc": "Atæshia uses her Kindled Sacrifice villain action, even if it is unavailable,\
    \ to sacrifice herself."
  "name": "From Death, Life (1/Day)"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "Atæshia forms into a cloud of ash, teleports to an unoccupied space she\
    \ can see within 60 feet of her, and reforms into her true form. Each creature\
    \ within 5 feet of the space she left must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving\
    \ throw or take 5 (1d10) fire damage."
  "name": "Flickering Flame"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When another Elemental Atæshia can see within 60 feet of her is hit with\
    \ an attack, the damage from the attack is halved and the target can move up to\
    \ half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks."
  "name": "Convocation of Ash"
"legendary_actions":
- "desc": "Atæshia has three villain actions. She can take each action once during\
    \ an encounter after an enemy's turn. She can take these actions in any order\
    \ but can use only one per round."
  "name": ""
- "desc": "Atæshia unleashes a pulse of overwhelming sadness. Each enemy Atæshia can\
    \ see within 120 feet of her must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, a creature is [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed) for\
    \ 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). On a successful save, a creature can't\
    \ take reactions until the end of their next turn."
  "name": "Action 1: Wave of Sorrow"
- "desc": "Atæshia chooses a willing creature within 60 feet of her to die so their\
    \ allies may live. The target dies, and up to two other dead creatures within\
    \ 60 feet of the target return to life. These revived creatures regain the same\
    \ number of hit points the sacrificed creature had, up to the revived creature's\
    \ hit point maximum."
  "name": "Action 2: Kindled Sacrifice"
- "desc": "Atæshia releases a torrent of primordial anguish to unmake the marrow of\
    \ creation around her. Each enemy within 60 feet of her must make a DC 21 Charisma\
    \ saving throw. On a failed save, they take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage and can't\
    \ regain hit points until the end of Atæshia's next turn. On a successful save,\
    \ they take half as much damage, but suffer no other effect. Succeed or fail,\
    \ if this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, they immediately fail one\
    \ death saving throw."
