  "name": "Pilum"
- "desc": "The centurion ignites a pilum then uses it to make a ranged Pilum attack\
    \ against a target within 60 feet of them. Hit or miss, the target and each creature\
    \ in a 5-foot-wide line between the target and the centurion must succeed on a\
    \ DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) fire damage. The line smolders\
    \ for 1 minute, creating a 5-foot-wide, 20-foot-tall wall of opaque smoke. A creature\
    \ within reach of the pilum can use an action to extinguish it, causing the smoke\
    \ to dissipate."
  "name": "Firetail Pilum (2/Day)"
- "desc": "The centurion straps a vial of unstable ores to a pilum then uses it to\
    \ make a ranged Pilum attack against a target within 60 feet of them. Hit or miss,\
    \ the ores explode after the attack. The target and each creature within 10 feet\
    \ of them must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature\
    \ takes 7 (2d6) thunder damage, is knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone),\
    \ and is [deafened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened) for 1 minute\
    \ (save ends at end of turn). On a successful save, a creature takes only half\
    \ as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
    \ or [deafened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened)."
