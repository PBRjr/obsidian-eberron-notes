# [Evoker](Misc Files\CLI\compendium\bestiary\humanoid/evoker-vgm.md)
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 214, Eberron: Rising from the Last War*  

Evokers are specialist wizards who harness magical energy and elemental forces to destroy. Many tend to be hotheaded and aggressive. Others are cold and reserved, unleashing their power at just the right moment to exploit an opponent's weakness.
