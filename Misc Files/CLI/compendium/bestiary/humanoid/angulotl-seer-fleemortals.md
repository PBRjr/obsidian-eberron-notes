  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "Creatures within 30 feet of the seer can't hide from the seer. Creatures\
    \ who can't be targeted by divination magic are immune to this effect."
  "name": "Third Eye"

- "desc": "Melee Spell Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6)\

  "name": "Acid Grasp"
- "desc": "The seer fires two magical beams of radiant energy, each beam targeting\
    \ a creature the seer can see within 120 feet of them. Each target must succeed\
    \ on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) radiant damage and shed\
    \ dim light in a 10-foot radius for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). While\
    \ shedding light in this way, attack rolls against the target have advantage,\
    \ the target can't benefit from being [invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible),\
    \ and they can't take the Hide action."
  "name": "Refulgent Beam"
- "desc": "The seer creates a 5-foot-radius sphere filled with toxic gas in an unoccupied\
    \ space they can see within 60 feet of them. If undisturbed, this bubble lasts\
    \ for 1 minute then dissipates harmlessly. If a creature attacks the bubble, touches\
    \ it, enters its space, or otherwise disturbs it, the bubble bursts, and each\
    \ creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking\
    \ 27 (6d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful\
    \ one."
  "name": "Noxious Bubble (1/Day)"
- "desc": "Each enemy within 60 feet of the seer who can hear them must succeed on\
    \ a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage and be [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed)\
    \ for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn)."
