    \ ally who also has this trait, is wielding a shield, and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
    \ or [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). To benefit from this\
    \ trait, the signifer must be wielding a shield."
  "name": "Shield? Shield!"
- "desc": "Each kobold unit can have one or more signifers, whose weapon is their\
    \ unit's battle standard. If a signifer drops their signum, they use the kobold\
    \ tiro stat block instead. If an allied kobold tiro uses an action to pick up\
    \ a signum not carried by another creature, that tiro uses the kobold signifer\
    \ stat block instead. When a signifer or tiro's stat block changes in this way,\
    \ any conditions or effects currently affecting them remain active, and their\
    \ hit points and hit point maximum remain the same.\n\nA signum that isn't being\
    \ held by a creature can be damaged; it has AC 15, 5 hit points, and immunity\
    \ to poison and psychic damage."
