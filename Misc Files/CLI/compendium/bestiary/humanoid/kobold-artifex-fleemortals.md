    \ ally who also has this trait, is wielding a shield, and isn't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
    \ or [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). To benefit from this\
    \ trait, the artifex must be wielding a shield."
  "name": "Shield? Shield!"
"actions":
- "desc": "The artifex makes one Chain Hook attack and uses Activate Trap, if available."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 15/30 ft., one target. Hit:\
    \ 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature,\
    \ they must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 15 feet\
    \ toward the artifex."
  "name": "Chain Hook"
- "desc": "The artifex activates one of the following hidden traps; the artifex can't\
    \ use the same trap two rounds in a row:"
  "name": "Activate Trap (3/Day)"
- "desc": "The artifex chooses a point on the ground that they can see within 60 feet\
    \ of them, opening a concealed 15-foot-square trapdoor on the ground centered\
    \ on that point to reveal a 10-foot-deep pit trap lined with spikes. Creatures\
    \ on the ground in the trapdoor's area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.\
    \ On a failed save, a creature falls into the pit and takes 3 (1d6) piercing\
    \ damage from the spikes and 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall. On a\
    \ successful save, a creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space outside that\
    \ area."
  "name": "Spiky Pit Trap"
- "desc": "The artifex chooses a point on the ground that they can see within 60 feet\
    \ of them, causing a buried canister to erupt and release a 15-foot-radius, 10-foot-high\
    \ cylinder of swarming bees. When a creature enters the swarm's area for the first\
    \ time on a turn or starts their turn there, they must make a DC 12 Constitution\
    \ saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5 (2d4) poison damage and\
    \ is [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the end of\
    \ their next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage\
    \ and isn't [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned). At the\
    \ start of each of the artifex's turns, the swarm moves 10 feet away from the\
    \ artifex in a straight line. The swarm disperses after 1 minute or when the artifex\
    \ dies."
  "name": "Swarm of Bees Trap"
- "desc": "The artifex chooses a point on the ground that they can see within 60 feet\
    \ of them, igniting a concealed trench of oil and creating a 20-foot long, 15-foot\
    \ high, and 1-foot-thick wall of fire. When the wall appears, each creature within\
    \ its area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage\
    \ on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature who\
    \ enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends their turn there takes\
    \ 7 (2d6) fire damage. The wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute."
