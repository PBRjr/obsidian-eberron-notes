- "desc": "When the assassin has advantage on their attack roll against a creature\
    \ who isn't a Construct or an Undead, their attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage\
    \ and inflict a bleeding wound on the target that lasts until the bleeding creature\
    \ regains at least 1 hit point. A bleeding creature loses 2 hit points for each\
    \ bleeding wound they have at the start of their turn. Any creature who can reach\
    \ the target can use an action to stanch all the target's wounds, ending the effect."

    \ can see for 1 minute. The darkness spreads around corners. Except for the assassin,\
    \ a creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and mundane light\
    \ can't illuminate it. At the start of their turn, the assassin can move the darkness\
    \ up to 30 feet to a point they can see (no action required). If the assassin\
    \ takes damage, the effect ends."
