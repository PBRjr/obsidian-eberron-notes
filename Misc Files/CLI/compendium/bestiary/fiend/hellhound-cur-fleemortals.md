- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3\
    \ fire damage, and if the target isn't a hellhound and the attack was made by\
    \ more than one cur, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal\
    \ to 10 plus the number of curs who joined the attack. On a failed save, the target\
    \ is lit on fire for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn), or until the target\
    \ or another creature who can reach them uses an action to extinguish the flames.\
    \ A creature who is on fire at the start of their turn takes fire damage equal\
    \ to the number of curs who joined the attack. If a creature who is already on\
    \ fire is set on fire again on a subsequent turn, the damage isn't cumulative,\
    \ but the duration of the fire resets to 1 minute."
