- "desc": "When the wobalas's soul count is 0, they have advantage on attack rolls,\
    \ disadvantage on saving throws, and their Intelligence score becomes 3 (-4).\
    \ Additionally, the wobalas must use their movement on each of their turns to\
    \ move as close as possible to the nearest creature they can sense with their\
    \ soulsight, and then if they are able, they must use their action to attack and\
    \ attempt to kill that creature. The wobalas can't act with any other purpose\
    \ until they add 1 to their soul count."
  "name": "Lethe"
- "desc": "When the wobalas reduces a creature who isn't a Construct or an Undead\
    \ to 0 hit points or deals damage to a dying creature, the creature must make\
    \ a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the wobalas consumes the creature's\
    \ soul and adds 1 to the wobalas's soul count. A creature whose soul is consumed\
    \ in this way immediately dies, and they can't be restored to life by any means\
    \ short of a [wish](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell."

- "desc": "The wobalas chooses a creature they can see within 60 feet of them. The\
    \ target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or use their reaction,\
    \ if available, to move their speed away from the wobalas by the most direct route\
    \ possible, with no regard for their own safety. Creatures who can't be [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
    \ succeed on this saving throw automatically."
