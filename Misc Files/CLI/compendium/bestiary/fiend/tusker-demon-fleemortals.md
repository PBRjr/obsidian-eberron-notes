- "desc": "When the demon's soul count is 0, they have advantage on attack rolls,\
    \ disadvantage on saving throws, and their Intelligence score becomes 3 (-4).\
    \ Additionally, the demon must use their movement on each of their turns to move\
    \ as close as possible to the nearest creature they can sense with their soulsight,\
    \ and then if they are able, they must use their action to attack and attempt\
    \ to kill that creature. The demon can't act with any other purpose until they\
    \ add 1 to their soul count."

- "desc": "When the demon reduces a creature who isn't a Construct or an Undead to\
    \ 0 hit points or deals damage to a dying creature, the creature must make a DC\
    \ 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the demon consumes the creature's\
    \ soul and adds 1 to the demon's soul count. A creature whose soul is consumed\
    \ in this way immediately dies, and they can't be restored to life by any means\
