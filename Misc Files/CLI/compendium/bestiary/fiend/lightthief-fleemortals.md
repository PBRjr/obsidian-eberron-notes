- "desc": "The lightthief teleports inside a light source they can see within 15 feet\
    \ of them that is emitting bright or dim light. While inside the light source,\
    \ the lightthief has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the\
    \ light source. If the light source is extinguished by any means other than the\
    \ lightthief's Steal Light action, the lightthief is forced out, appears in an\
    \ unoccupied space of their choice within 5 feet of the light source, and is [paralyzed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed)\
    \ until the end of their next turn."
  "name": "Into the Light (Recharge 6)"
- "desc": "The lightthief can cause the light they are inside to erupt in a burst\
    \ of brilliant radiance. Each creature within 15 feet of the light source must\
    \ make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14\
    \ (4d6) radiant damage and loses any darkvision they have for 1 minute. On a\
    \ successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't lose their\
    \ darkvision. After this, the light source extinguishes and the lightthief appears\
    \ in an unoccupied space of their choice within 5 feet of the light source."
