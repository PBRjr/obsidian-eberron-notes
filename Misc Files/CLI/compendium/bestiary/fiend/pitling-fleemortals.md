- "desc": "When the pitling reduces a creature who isn't a Construct or an Undead\
    \ to 0 hit points or deals damage to a dying creature, the creature must make\
    \ a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the pitling consumes the creature's\
    \ soul, and the pitling becomes a Category 2 demon of the GM's choice with 1 soul.\
    \ A creature whose soul is consumed in this way immediately dies, and they can't\
    \ be restored to life by any means short of a [wish](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md)\
    \ spell. If the creature was reduced to 0 hit points by a group attack, the GM\
    \ picks one pitling who joined the attack to consume the soul."
