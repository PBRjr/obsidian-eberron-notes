- "desc": "If the wildling takes damage from an attack or as the result of a failed\
    \ saving throw, their hit points are reduced to 0. If the wildling takes damage\
    \ from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point\

    \ damage, and the target is [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
    \ by each wildling who joined the attack (escape DC 10 plus the number of wildlings\
    \ who have it [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)). Until\
    \ this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained),\
    \ and the wildling can't make a Flail attack against another creature. A wildling\
    \ can choose to release the [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
    \ creature while other wildlings still have them [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled),\
    \ reducing the escape DC accordingly."
