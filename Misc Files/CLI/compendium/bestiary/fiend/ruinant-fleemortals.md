"traits":
- "desc": "When the ruinant's soul count is 0, they have advantage on attack rolls,\
    \ disadvantage on saving throws, and their Intelligence score becomes 3 (-4).\
    \ Additionally, the ruinant must use their movement on each of their turns to\
    \ move as close as possible to the nearest creature they can sense with their\
    \ soulsight, and then if they are able, they must use their action to attack and\
    \ attempt to kill that creature. The ruinant can't act with any other purpose\
    \ until they add 1 to their soul count."
  "name": "Lethe"
- "desc": "When the ruinant reduces a creature who isn't a Construct or an Undead\
    \ to 0 hit points or deals damage to a dying creature, the creature must make\
    \ a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the ruinant consumes the creature's\
    \ soul and adds 1 to the ruinant's soul count. A creature whose soul is consumed\
    \ in this way immediately dies, and they can't be restored to life by any means\
    \ short of a [wish](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell."

  "name": "Bloodletting Claws"
- "desc": "The ruinant chooses up to three creatures they can see within 60 feet of\
    \ them who don't have all their hit points. Each target must make a DC 15 Constitution\
    \ saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as\
    \ much damage on a successful one."
  "name": "Salt Wounds (Costs 1 Soul)"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When a creature within 60 feet of the ruinant regains hit points from a\
    \ power, a spell, or a similar supernatural effect, the ruinant corrupts the effect.\
    \ The target regains no hit points, and the target and each of the ruinant's enemies\
    \ within 5 feet of the ruinant must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw\
    \ or take necrotic damage equal to half the number of hit points the effect would\
    \ have restored."
