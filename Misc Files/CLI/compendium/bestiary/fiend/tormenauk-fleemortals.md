- "desc": "When the tormenauk's soul count is 0, they have advantage on attack rolls,\
    \ disadvantage on saving throws, and their Intelligence score becomes 3 (-4).\
    \ Additionally, the tormenauk must use their movement on each of their turns to\
    \ move as close as possible to the nearest creature they can sense with their\
    \ soulsight, and then if they are able, they must use their action to attack and\
    \ attempt to kill that creature. The tormenauk can't act with any other purpose\
    \ until they add 1 to their soul count."
  "name": "Lethe"
- "desc": "When the tormenauk reduces a creature who isn't a Construct or an Undead\
    \ to 0 hit points or deals damage to a dying creature, the creature must make\
    \ a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the tormenauk consumes the creature's\
    \ soul and adds 1 to the tormenauk's soul count. A creature whose soul is consumed\
    \ in this way immediately dies, and they can't be restored to life by any means\
    \ short of a [wish](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell."

  "name": "Many Maws"
- "desc": "The tormenauk screeches, broadcasting a consumed soul's lifelong pain.\
    \ Each creature within 30 feet of the tormenauk who can hear them must make a\
    \ DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) psychic damage on a failed save,\
    \ or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures who knew the owner of\
    \ the burned soul have disadvantage on the saving throw."

"reactions":
- "desc": "When the tormenauk takes damage, they choose a creature they can see within\
    \ 30 feet of them to share the pain. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving\
    \ throw, taking psychic damage equal to the triggering damage taken by the tormenauk\
    \ on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
