- "desc": "The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17,\
    \ +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells,\
    \ requiring no material components:\n\nAt will: [detect evil and good](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/detect-evil-and-good-xphb.md),\
    \ [detect magic](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/detect-magic-xphb.md), [thunderwave](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/thunderwave-xphb.md),\
    \ [disguise self](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/disguise-self-xphb.md) (often\
    \ with a longer duration than is normal for that spell; see Disguises)\n\n1/day\
    \ each: [conjure elemental](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/conjure-elemental-xphb.md)\
    \ ([air elemental](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md)\

    \ form](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/gaseous-form-xphb.md), [invisibility](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/invisibility-xphb.md),\

    \ shift](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/plane-shift-xphb.md)\n\n3/day each:\
    \ [create food and water](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/create-food-and-water-xphb.md)\
    \ (can create wine instead of water), [tongues](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/tongues-xphb.md),\

    \ (mightier genies only; see Disguises)"
  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving\
    \ behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly\
    \ shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the [disguise self](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/disguise-self-xphb.md)\
    \ spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier\
    \ genies can cast the [true polymorph](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/true-polymorph-xphb.md)\
    \ spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal.\
    \ Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell\
    \ on other creatures and objects as well."
  "name": "Disguises"
"actions":
- "desc": "The djinni makes three scimitar attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12\
    \ (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's\
    \ choice)."
  "name": "Scimitar"
- "desc": "A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms\
    \ on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as\
    \ long as the djinni maintains [concentration](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
    \ (as if [concentrating](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on\
    \ a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed\
    \ on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures\
    \ [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the whirlwind\
    \ move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.\n\nA creature\
    \ can use its action to free a creature [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.\
    \ If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind."
