  "name": "Innate Spellcasting"
- "desc": "The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While\
    \ doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through."
  "name": "Earth Glide"
- "desc": "If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving\
    \ behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying."
  "name": "Elemental Demise"
- "desc": "The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against\
    \ effects that would knock it [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
  "name": "Sure-Footed"
- "desc": "The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most\
    \ potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie\
    \ that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a\
    \ genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again\
    \ for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same\
    \ genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that\
    \ creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of\
    \ the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the [wish](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md)\
    \ spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's\
    \ nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting\
    \ the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to\
    \ be to the genie's benefit."
