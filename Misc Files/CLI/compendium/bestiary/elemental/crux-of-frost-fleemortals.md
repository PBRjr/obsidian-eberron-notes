    \ the target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target\
    \ is [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of the crux\
    \ for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn), or until the crux stops reflecting\
    \ them. While [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) in\
    \ this way, whenever the target takes damage, they take an extra 11 (2d10) psychic\
    \ damage. On a successful save, the target isn't [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened),\
    \ and they are immune to the It Stares Back of all cruxes for 24 hours."
  "name": "It Stares Back (Recharge 5-6)"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "The crux imbues the power of ice in themself or another Elemental they\
    \ can see within 30 feet of them, granting one of the following effects of that\
    \ Elemental's choice:\n\n- Frigid Sheen. The Elemental gains a mirror sheen\
    \ that reflects damage for 1 minute. When the Elemental is hit with an attack\
    \ by a creature they can see within 30 feet of them, the Elemental can use a reaction\
    \ to reflect the attack. The Elemental is unaffected by the attack, and the attacker\
    \ must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the attack's damage\
    \ and effects are reflected back at the attacker as if the attack originated from\
    \ the Elemental, turning the attacker into the target. On a successful save, the\
    \ attacker takes half as much damage, but suffers no other effect.  \n- Frost\
    \ Squall. Frost swirls around the Elemental for 1 minute. For the duration,\
    \ each non-Elemental creature who starts their turn within 15 feet of the Elemental\
    \ has their speed reduced to 15 feet unless it is already lower until the end\
    \ of their turn, and the first time they willingly move before the start of their\
    \ next turn, they take 10 (3d6) cold damage.  "
