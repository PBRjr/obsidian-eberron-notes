    \ damage. If three or more crawling claws joined the attack, the target must succeed\
    \ on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease called gravefilth.\
    \ Whenever a power, a spell, or a similar supernatural effect causes a creature\
    \ with gravefilth to regain hit points, the number of hit points they regain is\
    \ halved. A creature with gravefilth can repeat the saving throw whenever they\
    \ finish a long rest. On a successful save, the disease is cured."
