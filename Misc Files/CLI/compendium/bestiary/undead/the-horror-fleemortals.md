    \ check to appeal to Elyas's departing soul (no action required). On a successful\
    \ check, his soul transforms the explosion and each enemy of the Grave Order within\
    \ 30 feet of the Horror gains 7 (2d6) temporary hit points. On a failed check\
    \ (or if no check is made), each creature within 15 feet of the Horror must make\
    \ a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) acid damage plus 4 (1d8)\
