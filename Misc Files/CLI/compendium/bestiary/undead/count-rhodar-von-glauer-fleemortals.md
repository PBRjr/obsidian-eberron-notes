  "name": "Resting Place"
- "desc": "Rhodar is surrounded by three floating spears of shimmering darkness, which\
    \ he can summon to a free hand on his turn (no action required). When Rhodar fails\
    \ an ability check or saving throw, he can choose to destroy one of these spears\

    \ spell, or a similar supernatural effect.\n\nThe target dies if this effect reduces\

- "desc": "Ranged Spell Attack: +12 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10\

    \ On a success, the creature is freed and the [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\

    \ area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be bloodstained until\
    \ the end of Rhodar's next turn. Rhodar has advantage on attack rolls against\

    \ or [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), that effect\
    \ ends for him. He then flies up to twice his speed to an unoccupied space. During\
    \ this move, Rhodar ignores difficult terrain, doesn't provoke opportunity attacks,\
    \ and can move through creatures and objects. Each creature Rhodar passes through\
    \ must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) fire damage on a\
    \ failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At the end of this\
    \ movement, Rhodar transforms back into his previous form."
  "name": "Action 2: Fire Drake"
- "desc": "Rhodar fills the area within 60 feet of him with thick swirling mists,\
