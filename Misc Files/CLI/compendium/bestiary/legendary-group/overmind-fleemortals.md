# Overmind

## Lair actions


When fighting inside their lair, an overmind can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the overmind can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the overmind can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Gas Belch.** A hole opens in the ceiling, floor, or wall at a point the overmind chooses within 60 feet of them and belches a 20-foot-sphere of smelly gas that lasts until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round. When a creature enters that area for the first time or starts their turn there, they must succeed on a DC  15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the start of their next turn.  
- **Slime Shower.** Viscous slime falls from the ceiling toward one enemy within 120 feet of the overmind. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. The effect ends when they take fire or lightning damage, or at the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Telekinetic Hold.** An invisible force attempts to grab three enemies within 60 feet of the overmind. Each creature must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature's speed becomes 0 and they rise vertically 20 feet in the air, suspended there until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round, at which point they fall.
