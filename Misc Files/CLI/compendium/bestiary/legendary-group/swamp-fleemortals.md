# Swamp

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the swamp creature can take one of the following lair actions; the swamp creature can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Swamp Camouflage.** The swamp creature can move up to half their speed and then make a Dexterity ([Stealth](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) check to hide, even if they are being observed by other creatures.  
- **Swamp Gas.** The swamp creature chooses a point on the ground that they can see within 120 feet of them, causing a pocket of acidic swamp gas to erupt from it. Each creature, other than the swamp creature, in a 20-foot cube centered on that point must succeed on a DC 12 plus PB Constitution saving throw or take `PBd6` acid damage.  
- **Swamp Medicine.** The swamp creature draws on the life energy of the swamp and regains `PBd6` hit points.
