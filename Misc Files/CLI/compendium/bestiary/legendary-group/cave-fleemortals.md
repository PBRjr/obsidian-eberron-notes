# Cave

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the cave creature can take one of the following lair actions; the cave creature can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Rocky Bulwark.** The cave creature magically attracts nearby stones, forming a stone armor that grants a +PB bonus to AC but reduces their speed by 10 feet. The creature loses the armor at the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Strategic Blockage.** The cave creature causes loose rocks to fall, creating a 15-foot cube of solid earth centered on a point within 60 feet of them. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 plus PB Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `PBd6` bludgeoning damage and is pushed into the nearest unoccupied space of the cave creature's choice outside that area. On a successful save, a creature takes no damage and is moved into the nearest unoccupied space of their choice outside that area. A creature within reach of the cube can use an action to remove a section of the cube as large as the space the creature occupies.  
- **Tremor.** The cave creature causes an earthquake centered on a point they can see within 60 feet of them. Each other creature on the ground within 30 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 plus PB Strength saving throw or fall [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
