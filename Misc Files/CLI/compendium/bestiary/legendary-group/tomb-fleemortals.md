# Tomb

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the tomb creature can take one of the following lair actions; the tomb creature can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Chorus of Torment.** The tomb creature commands the souls of the dead to wail. Each creature within 120 feet of the tomb creature must succeed on a DC 12 plus PB Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of the tomb creature until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Desecrated Ground.** The tomb creature draws in ambient necrotic power and gains 2 Ã— PB temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Grave Grasp.** The corpses and souls of the restless dead attempt to drag the living into their graves. All ground within 60 feet of the tomb creature becomes difficult terrain until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round. Undead creatures ignore this difficult terrain.
