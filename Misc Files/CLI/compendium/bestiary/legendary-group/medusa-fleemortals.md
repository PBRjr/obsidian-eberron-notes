# Medusa

## Lair actions


When fighting inside their lair, a medusa can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the medusa can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the medusa can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Venom Shower.** Black venom rains down in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point the medusa can see within 90 feet of them. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Shadowstep.** The medusa teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space they can see.  
- **Venom Shower.** The statues in the medusa's lair scream in pain. Each enemy within 60 feet of the medusa who can hear them must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) of the medusa until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.
