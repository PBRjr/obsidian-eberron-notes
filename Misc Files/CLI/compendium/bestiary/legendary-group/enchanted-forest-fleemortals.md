# Enchanted Forest

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the enchanted forest creature can take one of the following lair actions; the enchanted forest creature can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Frothing Flora.** The enchanted forest creature causes roots and vines to temporarily grow around them; until initiative count 20 on the next round, the ground within 30 feet of the enchanted forest creature is difficult terrain.  
- **Writhing Roots.** Foliage in the enchanted forest creature's lair becomes a conduit for the enchanted forest creature's power. The enchanted forest creature can target creatures of their choice that are touching such plant life within 90 feet of the enchanted forest creature. A target must succeed on a DC 12 plus PB Wisdom saving throw or take `PBd6` psychic damage and be [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 12 plus PB).  
- **Faerie Lights.** The enchanted forest creature creates dancing lights in a 20-foot cube at a point they can see within 120 feet of them. Each creature in that area who can see the lights must make a DC 12 plus PB Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is [blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded), outlined in light, and sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round. Attack rolls against an affected creature have advantage if the attacker can see them, and the affected creature can't benefit from being [invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible).
