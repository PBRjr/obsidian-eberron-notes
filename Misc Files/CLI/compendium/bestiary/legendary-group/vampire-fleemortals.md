# Vampire

## Lair actions


When fighting inside their lair, a vampire can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the vampire can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the vampire can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Children of the Night.** A swarm of bats and insects flies around the vampire, moving with them. The area within 30 feet of the vampire is heavily obscured for other creatures until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Blood Rain.** The vampire chooses a point they can see within 60 feet of them. Blood rains down in a 40-foothigh, 10-foot-radius cylinder centered on this point until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round. When a creature who isn't Undead in the cylinder takes necrotic damage, they take an extra 5 (`1d10`) necrotic damage.  
- **Obey My Desire.** The vampire exerts their will on those who surround them. Each creature within 60 feet of the vampire who can hear them must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the vampire until the end of this turn. Each charmed creature must immediately use their reaction, if available, to make a melee attack against another creature, to make a melee attack against themself, or to drop [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) (vampire's choice).
