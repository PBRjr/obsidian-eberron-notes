# Underground

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the underground creature can take one of the following lair actions; the underground creature can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Cloud of Darkness.** The underground creature creates a 20-foot-radius area of magical darkness centered on a point they can see within 60 feet of them. The underground creature can see through the darkness, which lasts until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round unless ended early by the dispel magic spell. Other creatures with [darkvision](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) can't see through this darkness, and light can't illuminate it unless created by a spell of 3rd level or higher.  
- **Feasting Call.** The underground creature lets out a frenzied cry. Until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round, each ally within 300 feet of the underground creature who can hear them becomes enraged. While enraged, a creature has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls, and attack rolls against them have advantage.  
- **Treacherous Ground.** The underground creature causes a tremor in the ground. Each creature within 30 feet of them must succeed on a DC 12 plus PB Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
