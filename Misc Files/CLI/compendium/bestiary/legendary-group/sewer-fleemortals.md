# Sewer

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sewer creature can take one of the following lair actions; the sewer creature can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Cave-In.** The sewer creature rakes debris from the ceiling or knocks loose an ancient column, and the sewer tunnel partially collapses in a 15-foot cube centered on a point the sewer creature can see within 60 feet of them. Creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Dexterity saving throw or take `PBd6` bludgeoning damage from the falling rubble. Additionally, soot and debris heavily obscure that area for the next round, and it becomes difficult terrain.  
- **Covered in Muck.** The sewer creature crushes a fungal growth near them, releasing a cloud of toxic spores. Each creature within 30 feet of the sewer creature must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Open Valves.** The sewer creature cranks a valve or breaks a pipe, causing sewage to gush from a point within 60 feet of the sewer creature. Each creature in a 10-footwide, 60-foot-long line originating from that point must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Strength saving throw or fall prone in the sewage and be pushed 15 feet away from the point where the sewage originated.
