# Lich

## Lair actions


When fighting inside their lair, a lich can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lich can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the lich can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Soul Sip.** The lich chooses two enemies they can see within 90 feet of them. Each target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 19 (`3d12`) necrotic damage as the lair absorbs a sliver of their soul.  
- **Spirit Shell.** The lich summons spirits to surround them until the end of initiative count 20 of the next round. For the duration, a creature who hits the lich with a melee attack must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed) until the start of the creature's next turn.  
- **Unnatural Born Leader.** The lich magnifies the power of their soulstone through the lair onto a creature they can see within 90 feet of them. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or use their reaction, if available, to move up to their speed and make a weapon attack against a creature of the lich's choice.
