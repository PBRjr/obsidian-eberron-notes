# Ruined Keep

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the ruined keep creature can take one of the following lair actions; the ruined keep creature can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Crumbling Rubble.** Pieces of the structure crumble into three 5-foot cubes within 30 feet of the ruined keep creature. Creatures in those areas must succeed on a DC 12 plus PB Dexterity saving throw or take `PBd6` bludgeoning damage. Those areas become difficult terrain.  
- **Express Descent.** The ruined keep creature collapses a 5-foot-square section of floor within 30 feet of them, opening a hole to the floor below. A Medium or smaller creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 plus PB Dexterity saving throw or fall through the floor.  
- **Swaying Structure.** Old timber and decrepit stone sways, shifts, and lurches. Each other creature within 60 feet of the ruined keep creature must succeed on a DC 12 plus PB Strength saving throw or fall [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). Flying creatures automatically succeed on this saving throw.
