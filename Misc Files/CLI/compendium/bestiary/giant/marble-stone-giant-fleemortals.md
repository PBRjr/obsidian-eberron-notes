    \ [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a successful save, the\
    \ creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ Each object in this line that isn't supernatural or worn or carried by a creature\
    \ takes 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage. At the end of its roll, the boulder crumbles,\

    \ the target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6)\
