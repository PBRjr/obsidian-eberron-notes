- "desc": "When the flunky targets a creature with an attack, another creature within\
    \ range of the attack can use their reaction to distract each flunky joining in\
    \ the attack. Each flunky who can see or hear the distracting creature joins a\
    \ group attack targeting that creature instead. If one or more flunkies can't\
    \ see or hear the distracting creature, those flunkies join a separate group attack\
    \ on the original target instead."

    \ maximum; otherwise they take no damage."
