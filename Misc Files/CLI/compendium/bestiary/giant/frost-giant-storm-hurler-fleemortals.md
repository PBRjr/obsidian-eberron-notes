"traits":
- "desc": "Wisps of stinging snow and icy winds surround the storm hurler. When an\
    \ enemy [concentrating](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration) on\
    \ a power, a spell, or a similar effect starts their turn within 15 feet of the\
    \ storm hurler, the enemy must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or\
    \ lose [concentration](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)."
  "name": "Oncoming Storm"
"actions":
- "desc": "The storm hurler makes two Ice Javelin attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 120/360 ft., one target. Hit:\
    \ 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage, and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet\
    \ until the end of their next turn."
  "name": "Ice Javelin"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 28\
    \ (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage."
  "name": "Slam"
- "desc": "The storm hurler throws up to three Medium ice javelins, each at an unoccupied\
    \ space they can see within 300 feet of them. These spaces must be within 30 feet\
    \ of each other. The javelins have AC 13, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to\
    \ fire damage. At the start of the storm hurler's next turn, any javelins with\
    \ hit points remaining explode, showering icicles in a 20-foot radius. Creatures\
    \ within the area of one or more explosions must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving\
    \ throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 (8d6) cold damage and is [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). On a successful save, a creature takes\
    \ half as much damage and isn't [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
    \ Objects within this area take 28 (8d6) cold damage."
  "name": "Flower of Frost (3/Day)"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When a creature within 120 feet of the storm hurler misses them with a\
    \ ranged weapon attack, the storm hurler can manipulate the storm surrounding\
    \ them to freeze the projectile and hurl it back at the attacker as an Ice Javelin\
    \ attack."
