- "desc": "When Aastrika fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.\
    \ When she does so, she can't use Sweltering Heat until the end of her next turn."
  "name": "Battle Tranquility (3/Day)"

    \ (4d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is\

  "name": "Sweltering Heat"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When another fire giant Aastrika can see within 60 feet of her misses with\
    \ a weapon attack, Aastrika causes flame to trail from the attacker. The attacker\

    \ amount as fire damage instead of taking the full amount of normal damage."
  "name": "Power of Flame"
"legendary_actions":

    \ an encounter after an enemy's turn. She can take these actions in any order\

    \ unoccupied space she can see within 30 feet of her. At the same time, five [fire\
    \ giant trooper](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/giant/fire-giant-trooper-fleemortals.md)s\
    \ appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of the space she teleported from.\
    \ The troopers act immediately after this villain action is taken and on the same\
    \ initiative count in subsequent rounds."

    \ giants must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) fire damage\
    \ on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
