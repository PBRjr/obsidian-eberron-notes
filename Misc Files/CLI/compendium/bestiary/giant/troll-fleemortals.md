- "desc": "When the troll is reduced to 0 hit points by any damage other than acid\
    \ or fire damage, they don't die or fall [unconscious](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious),\
    \ and can continue moving and taking actions as usual. The troll only dies if\
    \ they end their turn with 0 hit points, if acid or fire damage reduces them to\
    \ 0 hit points, or if they take acid or fire damage while they have 0 hit points."
  "name": "Relentless Hunger"
- "desc": "For 1 hour after sleep or another period of unconsciousness, the troll's\

- "desc": "The troll makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14\
    \ (3d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is not a Construct, an Elemental,\
    \ or a Plant, the troll regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. If this\
    \ attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the troll regains twice as many hit\
    \ points as they otherwise would with this attack."
  "name": "Bite"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7\
    \ (1d6 + 4) slashing damage."
  "name": "Claw"
- "desc": "The troll moves up to their speed in a straight line, smashing through\
    \ mundane obstacles in their path. The troll can enter the spaces of Large or\
    \ smaller creatures during this movement, forcing those creatures to make a DC\
    \ 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning\
    \ damage and falls [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). On a successful\
    \ save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\n\
    \nDuring this move, mundane objects that aren't worn or carried by a creature\
    \ take 14 (4d6) damage when the troll enters their space. If the troll moves\
    \ into the space of a Large or larger object and this damage doesn't destroy it,\
    \ the troll's movement stops and they are [stunned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned)\
    \ until the end of their next turn."
