    \ of them and places it on the bredbeddle's neck. The bredbeddle then polymorphs\
    \ into that Giant or Humanoid creature. While polymorphed, the bredbeddle's statistics\
    \ change as follows:\n\n- They can speak.  \n- They lose their Headless trait.\
    \  \n- Their size changes to match the creature whose head they bear.  \n- They\
    \ can see normally, and they gain any special senses the creature's head had.\
    \  \n- Any equipment they are wearing or carrying temporarily changes to match\
    \ their size, but the equipment's statistics do not change.  \n\nThe bredbeddle\
    \ reverts to their true form if they die, if their head is removed, or after 24\
    \ hours. When they revert, the head falls off and can't be reattached to the bredbeddle.\n\
    \nA creature who can reach the bredbeddle can use an action to make a DC 18 Strength\
    \ ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, removing the\
    \ head from the bredbeddle on a success."

    \ the head at a creature they can see within 60 feet of them.\n\nThe head lands\
    \ in the target's space, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving\
    \ throw or take 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage."
