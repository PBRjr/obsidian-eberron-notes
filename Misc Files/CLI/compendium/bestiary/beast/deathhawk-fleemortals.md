- "desc": "Within a range of 5 miles, the deathhawk can sense the presence of Undead\
    \ or corpses that have been dead for less than 90 days; the deathhawk knows the\
    \ general direction these are in but not their exact locations. In addition, the\
    \ deathhawk has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception))\
    \ checks made to find Undead or corpses that have been dead for less than 90 days."

  "name": "Beak"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11\
    \ (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature who isn't a Construct\
    \ or an Undead, they gain a bleeding wound that lasts until they regain at least\
    \ 1 hit point. A bleeding creature loses 5 (1d10) hit points for each bleeding\
    \ wound they have at the start of their turn. Any creature who can reach the target\
    \ can use an action to stanch all the target's wounds, ending the effect."
  "name": "Wounding Talons"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "The deathhawk shrieks, and each enemy within 300 feet of the deathhawk\
    \ who can hear them must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures who are immune\
    \ to the [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) condition\
    \ automatically succeed on this saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is\
    \ horrified for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). While horrified, each time\
    \ the creature makes an attack roll or a saving throw, they must roll a d4 and\
    \ subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.\n\nIf a creature's\
    \ saving throw is successful or the effect ends for them, they are immune to the\
    \ Bloodcurdling Shriek of all deathhawks for the next 24 hours."
