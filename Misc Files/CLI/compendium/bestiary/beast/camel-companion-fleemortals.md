- "desc": "The camel is considered to be one size larger for the purpose of determining\
    \ their carrying capacity."

    \ [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
    \ condition on themself."
  "name": "Stubborn"
- "desc": "If the camel's caregiver is Medium or smaller, the caregiver can occupy\
    \ the camel's space and vice versa, and it doesn't count as difficult terrain\
    \ for them."
  "name": "Tall and Narrow"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +3 plus PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:\
    \ 1d6 plus PB piercing damage (Bite) or bludgeoning damage (Kick)."
  "name": "Signature Attack (Bite or Kick)"
- "desc": "The camel spits at a creature they can see within 10 feet of them. The\
    \ target must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)\
    \ until the start of the camel's next turn."
  "name": "1st Level: Bilious Spit (2 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The camel moves up to their speed and makes a signature Bite attack against\
    \ one target. If the attack hits and the target is Medium or smaller, the camel\
    \ also shakes and flings them up to 10 feet away horizontally. If the target hits\
    \ a solid surface, they are knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
    \ and take an extra PB bludgeoning damage."

- "desc": "The camel moves up to their speed. During this move, they can move through\
    \ other creature's spaces. Each Large or smaller creature whose space the camel\
    \ passes through must make a DC 10 plus PB Strength saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, a creature takes PBd6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked\
    \ [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."

"reactions":
- "desc": "If the camel's caretaker falls [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
    \ and the camel can see them, the camel moves up to their speed toward their caregiver.\
    \ If they end this movement in the same space as their caregiver, attacks against\
    \ the caregiver have disadvantage until either the caregiver is no longer [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone),\
    \ the caregiver is no longer in the same space as the camel, or the start of the\
    \ camel's next turn, whichever comes first."
