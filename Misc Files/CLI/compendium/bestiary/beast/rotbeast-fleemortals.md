    \ creature within 5 feet of them must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw\
    \ or gain a level of [exhaustion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion)\
    \ and become infected with forest rot disease. An infected creature regains half\
    \ the normal number of hit points when they spend Hit Dice or finish a long rest,\
    \ and they can't reduce their [exhaustion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion)\
    \ level by finishing a long rest.\n\nEach time a creature with forest rot finishes\
    \ a long rest, they must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,\
    \ the creature gains another level of [exhaustion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).\
    \ On a successful save, the creature loses a level of [exhaustion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).\n\
    \nIf a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [exhaustion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion)\
    \ below 1, the creature recovers from the disease."
