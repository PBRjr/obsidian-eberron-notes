- "desc": "When a non-minion voiceless talker within 30 feet of the graywarper uses\

    \ one target. Hit: 4 psychic damage. If the target is a creature and if three\
    \ or more graywarpers joined the attack, the target must make a Charisma saving\
    \ throw. The DC for this saving throw is 11 plus the number of graywarpers who\
    \ joined the attack. On a failed save, the target becomes phased until the end\
    \ of their next turn. While phased, the creature is translucent and immaterial,\
    \ and they deal half damage with weapon attacks and unarmed strikes."
