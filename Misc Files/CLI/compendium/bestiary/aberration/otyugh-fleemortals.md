"traits":
- "desc": "The otyugh has seven adjustable appendages, which they can convert into\
    \ other appendages using their Transform bonus action. In their natural state,\
    \ the otyugh has one eyestalk, three legs, and three tentacles. These appendages\
    \ grant the following benefits:\n\n- Eyestalks. The otyugh's first eyestalk\
    \ gives them darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and immunity to the [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed)\
    \ condition, and each additional eyestalk increases their darkvision's range by\
    \ 60 feet. If the otyugh has no eyestalks, they are [blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded)\
    \ and lose immunity to the [flanked](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Flanked)\
    \ condition.  \n- Legs. Each leg gives the otyugh a cumulative walking speed\
    \ of 15 feet.  \n- Tentacles. The otyugh's number of tentacles determine how\
    \ many attacks they can make with Multiattack and how many creatures they can\
    \ grapple with Tentacle Slam.  "
  "name": "Adjustable Appendages"
- "desc": "The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature\
    \ within 120 feet of them that can understand a language. This form of telepathy\
    \ doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond."
  "name": "Limited Telepathy"
- "desc": "At the start of each of the otyugh's turns, each creature [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
    \ by the otyugh has their hit point maximum reduced by 5 (1d10) for 1 hour.\
    \ The otyugh regains the same number of hit points. This effect can't reduce a\
    \ creature's hit point maximum below their current hit points."
  "name": "Rot Leech"
- "desc": "The otyugh ignores difficult terrain. They also have advantage on Dexterity\
    \ ([Stealth](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in\
    \ piles of refuse."
  "name": "Trash Traversal"
- "desc": "A creature who starts their turn within 10 feet of the otyugh must succeed\
    \ on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)\
    \ until the start of the creature's next turn."
  "name": "Vile Stench"
"actions":
- "desc": "The otyugh makes one Tentacle Slam attack for each tentacle they currently\
    \ have (see Adjustable Appendages)."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21\
    \ (4d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution\
    \ saving throw or be diseased with otyuck. A creature with otyuck can't take the\
    \ Dash action and their speed is halved."
  "name": "Bite"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7\
    \ (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing damage. If the target\
    \ is Medium or smaller, they are [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
    \ (escape DC 13) and [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ until the grapple ends. The otyugh can grapple one target for each tentacle\
    \ they currently have."
