- "desc": "When the artillerist hits a target with their Psionic Rifle attack, the\
    \ artillerist can attempt to teleport the target (no action required). The target\
    \ must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied\
    \ space the artillerist can see within 60 feet of the artillerist."

"actions":
- "desc": "The artillerist makes two Psionic Rifle attacks, or they manifest a power\
    \ and make one Phasing Tentacles attack."

    \ 21 (3d10 + 5) force damage."
  "name": "Psionic Rifle"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21\
    \ (3d10 + 5) psychic damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the artillerist\
    \ can choose one of the following effects: the target is [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
    \ (escape DC 17) or teleported up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space the artillerist\
    \ can see."
  "name": "Phasing Tentacles"
- "desc": "The artillerist psionically plunders the mind of a creature they can see\
    \ within 30 feet of them. The target must make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw.\
    \ On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) psychic damage, and until they\
    \ finish a long rest or die, their proficiency bonus is lowered by 1 and the artillerist\
    \ gains a cumulative +2 bonus to damage rolls. On a successful save, a target\
    \ takes half as much damage and doesn't have their proficiency bonus reduced.\n\
    \nA creature whose proficiency bonus drops to 0 can't form new thoughts or speak,\
    \ and they have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws."
  "name": "Memory Thief (5th-Order Power)"
- "desc": "The artillerist projects a psionic image over their body, transforming\
    \ their appearance for 1 hour into that of a Medium creature they have seen. When\
    \ they manifest this power, they can also change the appearance of any equipment\
    \ they carry for the duration.\n\nThe changes wrought by this power fail to hold\
    \ up to physical inspection. A creature can use an action to inspect the artillerist's\
    \ appearance and make a DC 17 Intelligence ([Investigation](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
    \ check, noticing the image is a projection on a success."
  "name": "Guise (3rd-Order Power)"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "The artillerist cloaks themself from the sight of a creature the artillerist\
    \ can see within 60 feet of them. The creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom\
    \ saving throw or the artillerist becomes [invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible)\
    \ to the creature for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). This effect ends early\
    \ if the artillerist attacks the creature, deals damage to them, or creates an\
    \ effect that forces them to make a saving throw."
