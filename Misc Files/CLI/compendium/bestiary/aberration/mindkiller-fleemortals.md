    \ Medium or smaller creature, they are [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\

    \ 13 (3d6 + 3) psychic damage, and the mindkiller is [invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible)\
    \ to the target until the end of the mindkiller's next turn."
  "name": "Concealing Strike"
- "desc": "A Humanoid [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) by\
    \ the mindkiller must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or the mindkiller\
    \ enters the Humanoid's body. While inside a Humanoid, the mindkiller has total\
    \ cover against attacks and other effects originating outside the Humanoid, and\
    \ the only action the mindkiller can take is to leave the body, exiting in an\
    \ unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.\n\nWhen a Humanoid ends their turn\
    \ with the mindkiller inside of them, they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution\
    \ saving throw or take 10 necrotic damage. If the Humanoid is reduced to 0 hit\
    \ points, they die and the mindkiller takes over the body, which regains hit points\
    \ equal to the Humanoid's hit point maximum. The mindkiller retains their Intelligence,\
    \ Wisdom, and Charisma scores, their understanding of Deep Speech and Undercommon,\
    \ and their telepathy. They otherwise adopt the target's statistics and can take\
    \ the actions the creature could take. They know everything the creature knew,\
    \ including spells, class features, traits, and languages. If the body is reduced\
    \ to 0 hit points after the mindkiller takes control, the mindkiller must leave\
    \ it.\n\nA creature wielding a sharp tool or weapon within reach of a Humanoid\
    \ host or body with a mindkiller inside can use an action to attempt to remove\
    \ the mindkiller, making an attack roll against the Humanoid's AC if the host\
    \ is unwilling. On a hit, the creature deals 11 (2d10) slashing damage to the\
    \ host and must make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine))\
    \ check. On a successful check, the creature cuts the mindkiller out of the host.\
    \ On a faiIed check, if this slashing damage reduced the host to 0 hit points,\
    \ the mindkiller kills the host; otherwise, there is no effect."
