- "desc": "The voiceless talker psionically plunders the mind of a creature they can\
    \ see within 30 feet of them. The target must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving\
    \ throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage, and until\
    \ they finish a long rest or die, their proficiency bonus is cumulatively lowered\
    \ by 1 and the voiceless talker gains a cumulative +2 bonus to damage rolls. On\
    \ a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and doesn't have their\
    \ proficiency bonus reduced.\n\nA creature whose proficiency bonus drops to 0\
    \ can't form new thoughts or speak, and they have disadvantage on ability checks,\
    \ attack rolls, and saving throws."

  "name": "Flay (3/Day; 5th-Order Power)"
- "desc": "The voiceless talker projects a psionic image over their body, transforming\
    \ their appearance for 1 hour into that of a Medium creature they have seen. When\
    \ they manifest this power, they can also change the appearance of any equipment\
    \ they carry for the duration.\n\nThe changes wrought by this power fail to hold\
    \ up to physical inspection. A creature can use an action to inspect the voiceless\
    \ talker's appearance and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
    \ check, noticing the image is a projection on a success."
