- "desc": "A [dazed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed) enemy who starts\
    \ their turn within 20 feet of the gibbering mouther must make a DC 13 Wisdom\
    \ saving throw. On a failed save, that creature's body is altered in an otherworldly\
    \ way of the GM's choiceâ€”they might flicker in and out of reality, sprout miniature\
    \ fingers from their fingers, or have their physical form altered in a similarly\
    \ alien way. This alteration doesn't affect the creature's game statistics. A\
    \ cure ailment power of 4th order or higher, a [greater restoration](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md)\
    \ spell, or a similar supernatural effect reverses this alteration.\n\nWhile altered\
    \ in this way, a creature must repeat the saving throw whenever they finish a\
    \ long rest. On a failed save, their previous alteration worsens or they experience\
    \ another chaotic alteration of the GM's choice. If a creature fails this saving\
    \ throw three times after their initial alteration, they transform into a gibbering\
    \ mouther controlled by the GM, and only a [wish](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md)\
    \ spell can restore the creature to their original form."
