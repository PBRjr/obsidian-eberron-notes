"traits":
- "desc": "Six eyes float around the overmind and create their Eye Psionics effects.\
    \ Each eye is an object that has AC 24, 1 hit point, and a psionic shield that\
    \ makes it immune to damage. After an eye creates a psionic effect, it loses its\
    \ psionic shield until the start of the overmind's next turn. If an eye is destroyed,\
    \ a new eye pops out of the overmind's face to replace it at the end of their\
    \ next turn."
  "name": "Detached Eyes"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14\
    \ (4d6) piercing damage."
  "name": "Bite"
- "desc": "The overmind creates three of the following psionic eye effects. Unless\
    \ otherwise stated, each eye targets a creature who the overmind can see within\
    \ 120 feet of them. They can't use the same effect twice in a turn.\n\n- 1.\
    \ Charm Beam. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw\
    \ or be [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by the overmind\
    \ for 1 hour, or until the overmind harms the creature or one of their allies.\
    \  \n- 2. Compulsion Beam. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence\
    \ saving throw or use their reaction, if available, to move up to their speed\
    \ toward the closest ally they can see and make a weapon attack against them.\
    \ Creatures who can't be [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ are unaffected.  \n- 3. Toxic Vapors. The overmind chooses a point they\
    \ can see within 120 feet of them. Each creature within 10 feet of the point must\
    \ succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)\
    \ for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).  \n- 4. Telekinetic Beam. The targeted\
    \ creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be moved up to 30\
    \ feet in any direction and take 7 (2d6) force damage at the end of the move.\
    \ Alternatively, the overmind can target an object they can see within 120 feet\
    \ of them that weighs 300 pounds or less and isn't being worn or carried, moving\
    \ it up to 30 feet in any direction. The overmind can also exert fine control\
    \ on objects with this effect, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a\
    \ door or a container.  \n- 5. Lightning Bolt. The overmind shoots a 5-foot-wide,\
    \ 60-foot-long line of lightning. Each creature in the line must succeed on a\
    \ DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) lightning damage on a failed\
    \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- 6. Fire Beam. The\
    \ targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,\
    \ the target takes 36 (8d8) fire damage and catches fire, taking 9 (2d8) fire\
    \ damage at the start of each of their turns for 1 minute (save ends at end of\
    \ turn). Any creature can use their action to douse the fire, ending the effect\
    \ early.  "
  "name": "Eye Psionics"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "The overmind's central eye turns solid black and projects a 150-foot cone\
    \ of energy. If the overmind or any creature in that area is affected by a spell,\
    \ the spell's effects immediately end for that creature."
  "name": "The Great Eye (Recharge 6)"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When a creature within 5 feet of the overmind hits them with a melee attack,\
    \ the overmind can use Telekinetic Beam on the attacker."
  "name": "Away with You!"
"lair_actions":
- "desc": "When fighting inside their lair, an overmind can take lair actions. On\
    \ initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the overmind can take one lair\
    \ action to cause one of the following effects; the overmind can't use the same\
    \ lair action two rounds in a row:"
  "name": ""
- "desc": "- Gas Belch. A hole opens in the ceiling, floor, or wall at a point\
    \ the overmind chooses within 60 feet of them and belches a 20-foot-sphere of\
    \ smelly gas that lasts until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.\
    \ When a creature enters that area for the first time or starts their turn there,\
    \ they must succeed on a DC  15 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)\
    \ until the start of their next turn.  \n- Slime Shower. Viscous slime falls\
    \ from the ceiling toward one enemy within 120 feet of the overmind. The creature\
    \ must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be vulnerable to fire and\
    \ lightning damage. The effect ends when they take fire or lightning damage, or\
    \ at the end of initiative count 20 on the next round.  \n- Telekinetic Hold.\
    \ An invisible force attempts to grab three enemies within 60 feet of the overmind.\
    \ Each creature must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature's\
    \ speed becomes 0 and they rise vertically 20 feet in the air, suspended there\
    \ until the end of initiative count 20 on the next round, at which point they\
    \ fall.  "
