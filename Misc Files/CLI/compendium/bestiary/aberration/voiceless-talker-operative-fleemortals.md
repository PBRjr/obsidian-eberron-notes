    \ throw or be teleported up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space on the ground that\
    \ the operative can see."
  "name": "3rd Level: Phasing Charge (3/Day)"
- "desc": "As an action, the operative releases a powerful pulse of energy. Each enemy\
    \ within 10 feet of the operative must make a DC 10 plus PB Strength saving throw.\
    \ On a failed save, a creature takes PBd6 force damage and is pushed up to 10\
    \ feet directly away from the operative. On a successful save, a creature takes\
    \ half as much damage and isn't pushed."
  "name": "5th Level: Telekinetic Repulsion (3/Day)"
- "desc": "The operative psionically plunders the mind of a creature they can see\
    \ within 30 feet of them. The target must make a DC 10 plus PB Intelligence saving\
    \ throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage, and for\
    \ 1 minute, the target's proficiency bonus is cumulatively lowered by 1 and the\
    \ infiltrator gains a cumulative +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and to each\
    \ feature's save DC. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage\
    \ and doesn't have their proficiency bonus reduced.\n\nA creature whose proficiency\
    \ bonus drops to 0 can't form new thoughts or speak, and they have disadvantage\
    \ on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws."
