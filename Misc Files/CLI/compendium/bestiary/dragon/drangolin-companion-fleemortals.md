"traits":
- "desc": "The drangolin can burrow through solid rock at half their burrow speed\
    \ and leaves behind a 3-foot-diameter tunnel when they burrow. Tiny and Small\
    \ creatures can move through this tunnel normally, and Medium and Large creatures\
    \ can squeeze through it. This tunnel collapses after 10 minutes."
  "name": "Tunneler"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +3 plus PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:\
    \ 1d6 plus PB slashing damage."
  "name": "Signature Attack (Claws)"
- "desc": "The drangolin breathes fire at their foe. This attack uses the statistics\
    \ for their signature attack, except the fire is a ranged weapon with a normal\
    \ range of 30 feet and a long range of 60 feet. On a hit, the attack deals an\
    \ extra PB damage, and all the damage dealt by the attack is fire damage instead\
    \ of piercing damage."
  "name": "1st Level: Spit Breath (2 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The drangolin moves up to their walking speed in a straight line without\
    \ provoking opportunity attacks. The drangolin can end this movement in a space\
    \ that contains another creature. If they do, that creature takes 2 × PB bludgeoning\
    \ damage for every 10 feet the drangolin traveled, and they must make a DC 10\
    \ plus PB Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ On a successful save, the creature is pushed 5 feet out of the drangolin's space\
    \ into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice."
  "name": "3rd Level: Roll Out (5 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The drangolin makes two signature attacks against the same target, then\
    \ breathes fire on them. The target must make a DC 10 plus PB Dexterity saving\
    \ throw, taking PBd6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on\
    \ a successful one."
  "name": "5th Level: Rend and Roast (8 Ferocity)"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When an enemy the drangolin can see moves within 5 feet of the drangolin's\
    \ caregiver, the drangolin sprays the enemy with ash. If the drangolin is within\
    \ 30 feet of their caregiver, the target must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Dexterity\
    \ saving throw or be [blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) until\
    \ the start of the drangolin's next turn."
