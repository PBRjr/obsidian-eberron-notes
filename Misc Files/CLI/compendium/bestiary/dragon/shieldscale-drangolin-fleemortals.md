"traits":
- "desc": "The drangolin can burrow through solid rock at half their burrow speed\
    \ and leaves behind a 3-foot-diameter tunnel when they burrow. Tiny and Small\
    \ creatures can move through it normally, and Medium and Large creatures can squeeze\
    \ through it. This tunnel collapses after 10 minutes."
  "name": "Tunneler"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10\
    \ (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage."
  "name": "Fiery Claws"
- "desc": "If the drangolin is burrowing within 10 feet of the surface, they can erupt\
    \ from the ground (without spending movement) into a space that contains one or\
    \ more creatures. When they do, each creature within 10 feet of the drangolin\
    \ must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. A creature directly above the drangolin\
    \ when they emerge has disadvantage on this saving throw. On a failed save, a\
    \ creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ On a successful save, a creature takes only half as much damage and is pushed\
    \ 5 feet to an unoccupied space of their choice instead of being knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
  "name": "Erupt (1/Day)"
- "desc": "The drangolin moves up to twice their walking speed in a straight line\
    \ without provoking opportunity attacks. While doing so, they can enter Large\
    \ or smaller creatures' spaces. If the drangolin enters another creature's space\
    \ during this move, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw\
    \ or take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the drangolin\
    \ enters the space of a structure or object that isn't being worn or carried,\
    \ it takes twice as much damage."
  "name": "Wrecking Ball (1/Day)"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When a creature the drangolin can sense moves within 5 feet of them, the\
    \ drangolin sprays them with a cloud of ash. The target must succeed on a DC 13\
    \ Dexterity saving throw or be [blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded)\
    \ until the start of their next turn."
