  "name": "1st Level: Distracting Attack (2 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The ooze takes the Hide action and makes a signature attack (in either\
    \ order). If the attack hits a Large or smaller creature, the target is knocked\
    \ [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). While the ooze is hidden\
    \ in this way, they can approach a creature or move where they're clearly visible\
    \ without automatically giving away their position."
  "name": "3rd Level: Clever Goop (5 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The ooze attempts to enter the body of a creature they can see within 5\
    \ feet of them who isn't a Construct or an Undead. The target must make a DC 10\
    \ plus PB Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the ooze melds into the\
    \ target, who takes PBd6 necrotic damage, becomes the ooze's host, and is [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)\
    \ until the ooze exits the host.\n\nWhile melded, the ooze has total cover against\
    \ attacks and other effects originating outside the host, and they can't take\
    \ any action except to exit the host as a bonus action.\n\nAt the start of each\
    \ of the ooze's turns, the host must make a DC 10 plus PB Constitution saving\
    \ throw. On a failed save, the host takes PBd6 necrotic damage and remains melded.\
    \ On a successful save, the host takes half as much damage and the ooze exits\
    \ the host. If the host dies or is subject to a cure ailment power, a protection\
    \ from poison or [lesser restoration](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/lesser-restoration-xphb.md)\
    \ spell, or a similar supernatural effect, the ooze exits the host.\n\nWhen the\
    \ ooze exits the host, they enter an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the host."
  "name": "5th Level: Crimson Feast (8 Ferocity)"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "If the ooze's caregiver is within 5 feet of them, the ooze moves inside\
    \ their caregiver. While inside their caregiver, the ooze has total cover against\
    \ attacks and other effects originating outside the caregiver. The ooze can exit\
    \ the caregiver by using another bonus action, entering an unoccupied space within\
    \ 5 feet of the caregiver."
  "name": "Parasitic Symbiosis"
- "desc": "While inside their caregiver (see Parasitic Symbiosis), the ooze cleanses\
    \ their caregiver's blood, ending the [paralyzed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed)\
