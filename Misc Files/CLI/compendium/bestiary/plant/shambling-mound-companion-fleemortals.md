- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +3 plus PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:\

  "name": "Signature Attack (Vine Lash)"
- "desc": "The mound makes a signature attack with a reach of 30 feet instead of 5\
    \ feet.\n\nIf this attack hits a Medium or smaller creature, the mound can pull\
    \ the target up to 10 feet toward the mound."
  "name": "1st Level: Long-Range Lash (2 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The mound targets up to PB creatures within 30 feet of them who are Large\
    \ or smaller. Each target must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Dexterity saving throw\
    \ or be pulled up to 15 feet toward the mound and take PBd4 poison damage."
  "name": "3rd Level: Verdant Roundup (5 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The mound attempts to pull a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of\
    \ them into their body. The target must make a DC 10 plus PB Strength saving throw.\
    \ On a failure, the target is pulled into the mound's space, takes PBd8 poison\
    \ damage, and is engulfed. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage,\
    \ doesn't move, and isn't engulfed.\n\nAn engulfed creature is [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained),\
    \ has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the mound, and takes\
    \ PBd8 poison damage at the start of each of the mound's turns. When the mound\
    \ moves, the engulfed creature moves with them. An engulfed creature can try to\
    \ escape by taking an action to make a DC 10 plus PB Strength check. On a success,\
    \ that creature is freed and shunted to an unoccupied space of their choice within\
    \ 5 feet of the mound.\n\nThe mound can have one Large or up to four Medium or\
    \ smaller creatures engulfed at a time."
