"traits":
- "desc": "While the willow remains motionless, they are indistinguishable from a\
    \ normal willow tree."
  "name": "False Appearance"
- "desc": "If the willow takes fire damage, they catch fire and take 7 (2d6) fire\
    \ damage at the start of each of their turns for 1 minute. The effect ends early\
    \ if the willow takes cold damage or a creature uses an action to extinguish the\
    \ flames."
  "name": "Flammable"
"actions":
- "desc": "The willow makes two Frenzied Branch attacks."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 12\
    \ (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the willow is on fire, this attack deals\
    \ an extra 3 (1d6) fire damage."
  "name": "Frenzied Branch"
- "desc": "Roots erupt from a point on the ground the willow can see within 60 feet\
    \ of them. Each creature in a 10-foot sphere centered on that point must succeed\
    \ on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
    \ and moved up to 30 feet toward the willow, taking 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage\
    \ for every 10 feet moved."
  "name": "Tugging Roots"
- "desc": "The willow showers salty droplets on their bower. Each creature within\
    \ 15 feet of the willow must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ by the willow (save ends at end of turn). While [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ in this way, a creature can't willingly move more than 15 feet away from the\
    \ willow. If a creature [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ in this way takes damage, the effect ends for them."
  "name": "Willow's Tears"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When a creature within 5 feet of the willow deals slashing damage to the\
    \ willow, the willow attempts to turn the creature into a tree. The target must\
    \ succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or their feet begin to transform\
    \ into tree roots and they are [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).\
    \ A creature [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) in\
    \ this way must repeat the saving throw at the end of their next turn. On a successful\
    \ save, the effect ends. On a failed save, they are transformed into a wooden\
    \ tree and are [petrified](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified). A\
    \ creature [petrified](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Petrified) in this\
    \ way resembles a normal tree of the same size as that creature, except the creature's\
    \ face appears carved into the trunk. If the willow dies, the petrification ends\
    \ and the creature reverts to their true form. A cure ailment power or [lesser\
    \ restoration](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/lesser-restoration-xphb.md)\
    \ spell also ends this effect."
