"traits":
- "desc": "The thornblood is a mass of thick, thorny vines that grow from a Medium\
    \ humanoid corpse. When the thornblood is reduced to 0 hit points, they are reduced\
    \ to 1 hit point instead and retreat into the corpse that grew them.\n\nThe thornblood\
    \ becomes immune to all damage until the end of their next turn. Additionally,\
    \ until the thornblood finishes a long rest, their size becomes Medium, their\
    \ walking and climbing speeds become 60 feet, and they can't make Throttle attacks\
    \ or benefit from the Overgrowth trait."
  "name": "Corpse Retreat (1/Day)"

    \ thorny vines. While entangled, the target is [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ and moves with the thornblood, can't see outside their space, and takes 20 (4d6\
    \ + 6) piercing damage at the start of each of their turns. The target or another\
    \ creature within 5 feet of them can use their action to take 20 (4d6 + 6) slashing\
    \ damage and make a DC 20 Strength check, freeing the target on a success."
  "name": "Throttle"
- "desc": "The thornblood must have at least one creature entangled to use this action.\
    \ Each creature entangled by the thornblood must make a DC 20 Constitution saving\
    \ throw, taking 55 (10d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much\
    \ damage on a successful one. Then the thornblood shoots a bolt of lightning at\
    \ each enemy within 60 feet of them who isn't entangled by them. Each target must\
    \ make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) lightning damage on\
