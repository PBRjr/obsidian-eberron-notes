"traits":
- "desc": "The mound has a vegetative sack on their body where they carry engulfed\
    \ creatures. The sack can be attacked (AC 15; 50 hit points; immunity to poison\
    \ and psychic damage), which deals no damage to the mound. Destroying the sack\
    \ frees creatures trapped by the mound's Engulf action. The mound regrows the\
    \ sack at the beginning of their next turn."
  "name": "Engulfing Sack"
- "desc": "While the mound remains motionless, they are indistinguishable from an\
    \ ordinary mass of vegetation."
  "name": "False Appearance"
"actions":
- "desc": "The mound makes two Vine Lash attacks. They can replace one attack with\
    \ a use of Engulf, if available."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft.,\
    \ one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or\
    \ smaller, the mound can pull the target up to 30 feet toward them."
  "name": "Vine Lash"
- "desc": "The mound reaches out with writhing vines and attempts to pull in up to\
    \ two Medium or smaller creatures within 30 feet of them. Each target must succeed\
    \ on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be engulfed in the mound's engulfing sack.\
    \ An engulfed creature is [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained),\
    \ has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the mound, and takes\
    \ 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of the mound's turns. When the\
    \ mound moves, the engulfed creature moves with them. If the mound dies or their\
    \ engulfing sack is destroyed, each engulfed creature is freed and shunted to\
    \ an unoccupied space of their choice within 5 feet of the mound."
  "name": "Engulf (Recharge 5-6)"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When the mound takes damage, the inside of their engulfing sack churns\
    \ with poison. Each creature engulfed by the mound takes 3 (1d6) poison damage,\
    \ and the mound regains a number of hit points equal to the total damage dealt\
    \ by this reaction to creatures in their sack."
