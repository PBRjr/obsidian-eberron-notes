"traits":
- "desc": "The mimic can use their action to polymorph into a Small, Medium, or Large\
    \ object or back into their true amorphous form. Other than size, the mimic's\
    \ statistics are the same in each form. Anything they are wearing or carrying\
    \ isn't transformed. They revert to their true form if they die."
  "name": "Shapechanger"
- "desc": "While the mimic remains motionless, they are indistinguishable from an\
    \ ordinary object."
  "name": "False Appearance (Object Form Only)"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +3 plus PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:\
    \ 1d6 plus PB piercing damage."
  "name": "Signature Attack (Bite)"
- "desc": "The mimic makes a signature attack. On a hit, the attack deals its normal\
    \ effects, and the next attack made against the target before the start of the\
    \ mimic's next turn has advantage."
  "name": "1st Level: Distracting Attack (2 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The mimic attempts to adhere to each creature of their choice within 5\
    \ feet of them. Each target must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Dexterity saving throw\
    \ or be [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) (escape DC 10\
    \ plus PB)."
  "name": "3rd Level: Adhesive Pseudopods (5 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The mimic uses their Shapechanger trait to polymorph into one Large or\
    \ smaller creature they can see within 5 feet of them. Other than size, the mimic's\
    \ statistics do not change, and the mimic reverts to their previous form at the\
    \ start of their next turn.\n\nAfter transforming, the mimic can make a signature\
    \ attack against the target whose form they have taken. Hit or miss, the target\
    \ must then make a DC 10 plus PB Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, attacks\
    \ against the target have advantage and the target has disadvantage on attack\
    \ rolls and saving throws until the start of the mimic's next turn."
  "name": "5th Level: I'm You (8 Ferocity)"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "While the mimic is within 5 feet of their caregiver, the mimic can pull\
    \ themself into the caregiver's space, cover the caregiver's body, and take on\
    \ the appearance of clothing. While the caregiver is wearing the mimic, the mimic's\
    \ space is not difficult terrain for the caregiver, the caregiver has advantage\
    \ on Dexterity ([Stealth](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks, and\
    \ the caregiver can change the appearance of their mimic clothing at will (no\
    \ action required) as long as the caregiver and mimic aren't [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated).\n\
    \nAny attack that hits the caregiver also hits the mimic they are wearing, and\
    \ vice versa, with both taking the full damage and effect of the attack. While\
    \ worn in this way, the mimic can't move, and they can't take actions other than\
    \ using a bonus action to revert to their previous form. A mimic automatically\
    \ reverts to their previous form if they enter a rampage. Upon reverting to their\
    \ previous form, the mimic is no longer worn by their caregiver, and the mimic\
    \ enters the nearest unoccupied space of their choice."
