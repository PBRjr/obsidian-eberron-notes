    \ (no action required). The starving harpy continues harmonizing until the song\
    \ ends, until they choose to stop harmonizing, or until they become [deafened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Deafened)\
    \ or [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated). For\
    \ each starving harpy harmonizing, the range of the song increases by 50 feet,\
    \ and the save DCs for the singing harpy's Alluring Song action and Beckon bonus\
    \ action both increase by 1 (maximum DC increase of 5)."

    \ the target 10 feet instead of 5."
