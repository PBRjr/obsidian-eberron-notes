  "name": "Signature Attack (Bite)"
- "desc": "The lightbender makes a signature attack. On a hit, the attack deals an\
    \ extra PB radiant damage to the target, and a different creature the lightbender\
    \ chooses within 15 feet of them takes PB radiant damage."
  "name": "1st Level: Tail Whip (2 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "The lightbender teleports 30 feet to an unoccupied space they can see.\
    \ Before or after teleporting, the lightbender can make a signature attack. If\
    \ the attack hits, the target is knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
  "name": "3rd Level: Silent Pounce (5 Ferocity)"
- "desc": "Each creature within 10 feet of the lightbender must succeed on a DC 10\
    \ plus PB Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ by the lightbender until the end of the lightbender's next turn. While [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ in this way, a creature is [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
    \ and has a speed of 0. If a creature [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\

"reactions":
- "desc": "When the lightbender and their caregiver are within 30 feet of each other\
    \ and one of them is hit by an attack, the lightbender reveals that both they\
    \ and their caregiver are past visual imprints. The lightbender and the caregiver\
    \ each appear in an unoccupied space they can see within 30 feet of their imprints,\
    \ the attack misses, then the imprints disappear. The lightbender can't use this\
    \ reaction if the attacker relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight,\
    \ or if they can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight."
