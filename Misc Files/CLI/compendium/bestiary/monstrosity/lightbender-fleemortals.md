  "name": "Avoidance"
- "desc": "If the lightbender moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and\
    \ then hits them with a Claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed\
    \ on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ If the target is [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone), the lightbender\
    \ can make one Bite attack against them as a bonus action."

    \ on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ by the lightbender for 1 minute. While [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ in this way, a creature is [incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
    \ and has a speed of 0. If a creature [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ in this way takes damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature\
    \ out of their stupor, the condition ends for that creature."

"reactions":
- "desc": "When the lightbender is hit by an attack, they can reveal that the attacker\
    \ is attacking a past visual imprint of the lightbender. The lightbender appears\
    \ in an unoccupied space they can see within 30 feet of their imprint, the attack\
    \ misses, then the imprint disappears. The lightbender can't use this reaction\
    \ if the attacker relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if\
    \ they can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight."
