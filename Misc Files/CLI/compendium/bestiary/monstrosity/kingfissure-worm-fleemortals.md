"traits":
- "desc": "The worm has three tongues, each of which can be targeted with attacks\
    \ (AC 20, immunity to psychic damage) while that tongue is grappling a creature.\
    \ When a tongue takes 35 damage or more in a single turn, that tongue is destroyed,\
    \ releasing any target it was grappling. The worm can't use a destroyed tongue\
    \ with their Multiattack or Tongue Grab action until they finish a long rest.\
    \ Damaging or destroying a tongue deals no damage to the worm."
  "name": "Multiple Tongues"
- "desc": "When the worm fails a saving throw, they can choose to succeed instead.\
    \ When they do, their speed and the reach of their Tongue Grab attack are each\
    \ reduced by a cumulative 10 feet until they finish a long rest. The worm's speed\
    \ and reach can't be reduced below 5 feet in this way."
  "name": "Slowed, Not Stopped (3/Day)"
- "desc": "The worm can burrow through solid rock at half their burrowing speed and\
    \ leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in their wake."
  "name": "Tunneler"
"actions":
- "desc": "The worm can make a number of Tongue Grab attacks equal to the number of\
    \ tongues they currently have (see Multiple Tongues). The worm can replace any\
    \ number of those attacks with a use of Swallow."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 14\
    \ (4d6) acid damage, and the creature is [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
    \ (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the worm can't use this tongue against\
    \ another target."
  "name": "Tongue Grab"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22\
    \ (3d8 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is Huge or smaller, they must succeed\
    \ on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed (as if by the worm's Swallow\
    \ action)."
  "name": "Maw"
- "desc": "The worm pulls a Huge or smaller [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
    \ creature into their maw and swallows them. A swallowed creature is no longer\
    \ [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled), but they are [blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded)\
    \ and [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained), have total\
    \ cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and take 28 (8d6)\
    \ acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.\n\nIf the worm takes 30\
    \ damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside them, the worm must succeed\
    \ on a DC 21 Constitution check at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed\
    \ creatures, each of whom fall [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
    \ in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed\
    \ creature can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
  "name": "Swallow"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "The worm violently swings a creature they have [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled).\
    \ The [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled) creature takes\
    \ 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage, and each enemy within 10 feet of the [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
    \ creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning\
    \ damage."
  "name": "Tongue Sweep"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When one of the worm's tongues takes damage that doesn't immediately destroy\
    \ it, the worm can release any target that tongue is grappling and recall the\
    \ tongue back inside the worm's body. That tongue can't be targeted until the\
    \ worm uses it to grapple a creature again."
  "name": "Tongue Recall"
"legendary_actions":
- "desc": "The worm has three villain actions. They can take each action once during\
    \ an encounter after an enemy's turn. They can take these actions in any order\
    \ but can use only one per round."
  "name": ""
- "desc": "The worm writhes, sending tremors through the ground and opening a 20-foot-wide,\
    \ 100-foot-long, 40-foot-deep fissure in the ground, originating from the worm.\
    \ Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed\
    \ save, a creature falls into the fissure, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage\
    \ from the fall and landing [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
    \ On a successful save, a creature flees to the closest unoccupied space outside\
    \ the fissure's area."
  "name": "Action 1: Open the Earth"
- "desc": "The worm burrows up to half their speed and then bursts through the surface,\
    \ breaching the ground in a 10-foot-radius circle. Huge and smaller creatures\
    \ within that area must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed\
    \ (as if by the worm's Swallow action)."
  "name": "Action 2: Earth Breach"
- "desc": "The worm projectile vomits the contents of their stomach in a 60-foot cone.\
    \ Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking\
    \ 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) acid damage on a failed save,\
    \ or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, creatures who were\
    \ swallowed by the worm are regurgitated, taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage\
    \ and landing [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) in an unoccupied\
    \ space of the worm's choice within that area."
