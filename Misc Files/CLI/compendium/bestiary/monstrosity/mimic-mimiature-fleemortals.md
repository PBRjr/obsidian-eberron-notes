    \ from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point\

- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 bludgeoning\
    \ damage. Until the end of the target's next turn, they have disadvantage on ability\
    \ checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple, and they have advantage on\
    \ ability checks made to initiate or maintain a grapple. Additionally, if three\
    \ or more mimiatures joined the attack, the target's appendages become so sticky\
    \ that until the end of the target's next turn, they can't cast spells with somatic\
    \ components, they can't drop objects, and they can't interact with objects other\
    \ the ones they are already holding."
  "name": "Sticky Swarm (Group Attack)"
- "desc": "The mimiature polymorphs into a Tiny object or back into their true amorphous\
    \ form. If four mimiatures within 5 feet of each other use this action together,\
    \ they can join together to become one Small object. Anything a mimiature is wearing\
    \ or carrying isn't transformed. A mimiature in object form reverts to their true\
    \ form if any mimiature in the group moves, takes an action, or dies."
