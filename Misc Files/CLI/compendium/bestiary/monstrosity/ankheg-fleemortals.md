    \ takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.\n\nA creature who is\
    \ bathed in acid takes 3 (1d6) acid damage at the start of each of their turns\

    \ spending movement) into a 10-foot square on the ground directly above them.\
    \ This area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature on the ground in this\
    \ area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature\
    \ is pushed 5 feet to an unoccupied space of the ankheg's choice and is [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
    \ by rubble. A creature can use their action to free themself or another creature\
    \ within their reach. On a successful save, a creature is moved 5 feet to an unoccupied\

- "desc": "If the ankheg is [grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled),\
