    \ leyleech chooses one of the target's spellcasting abilities. That ability score\
    \ is reduced by 1 (min- imum score of 1) until the target finishes a short or\
    \ long rest, and the leyleech's form becomes charged for 1 minute or until they\
    \ use Magic Purge."

    \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
