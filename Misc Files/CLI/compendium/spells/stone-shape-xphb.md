# Stone Shape
*4th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape you like.

You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
