# Sunbeam
*6th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line. Each creature in the Line makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `6d8` Radiant damage and has the [Blinded](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [Magic](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to create a new Line of radiance.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds [Bright Light](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius and [Dim Light](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Wizard](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Bard](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Druid](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
