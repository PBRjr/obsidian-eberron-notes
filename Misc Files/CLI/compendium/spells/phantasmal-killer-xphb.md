# Phantasmal Killer
*4th-level, Illusion*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusion of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `4d10` Psychic damage and has [Disadvantage](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.

For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Wizard](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Bard](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard (Illusionist)](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-illusionist-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
