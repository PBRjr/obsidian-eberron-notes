# Befuddlement
*8th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a key ring with no keys)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes `10d12` Psychic damage and can't cast spells or take the [Magic](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action. At the end of every 30 days, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by the [Greater Restoration](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md), [Heal](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/heal-xphb.md), or [Wish](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Classes**: [Wizard](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Bard](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Warlock](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Druid](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md)
