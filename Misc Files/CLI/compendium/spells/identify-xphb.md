# Identify
*1st-level, Divination (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pearl worth 100+ GP)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch an object throughout the spell's casting. If the object is a magic item or some other magical object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires [Attunement](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/attunement-xphb.md), and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any ongoing spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn that spell's name.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn which ongoing spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-xphb-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Wizard (Diviner)](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-diviner-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Artificer](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-artificer.md); [Cleric (Knowledge Domain)](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric-xphb-knowledge-domain.md "class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-xphb-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
