# Perfume of Bewitching
*Wondrous item, common*  



This tiny vial contains magic perfume, enough for one use. You can take a [Magic](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to apply the perfume to yourself, and its effect lasts 1 hour. For the duration, you have [Advantage](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on all Charisma ([Deception](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception) and [Persuasion](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks made to influence a creature within 5 feet of yourself.
