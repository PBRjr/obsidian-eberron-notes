# Waning Moon
*Weapon ([longbow](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/longbow-xphb.md)), rare (requires attunement)*  


- **Damage**: 1d8 piercing
- **Range**: 150/600
- **Properties**: [Ammunition](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Ammunition), [Heavy](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This slender elven bow is lacquered blue and purple.

Its inside curve twinkles with tiny diamonds set like a field of stars.

This magical longbow grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If you hit a creature who can't see you with this bow, the attack deals an extra `2d6` force damage.

Additionally, when you hit a target with an attack made with the bow, you can choose to become [invisible](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) for 1 minute and take the [Hide](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Hide) action as part of the attack.

The invisibility ends early if you attack, cast a spell, or manifest a power. Once this invisibility has been used, it can't be used again until the next dusk.
