# Iron Ring
*Ring, cursed item, rare (requires attunement)*  


- **Properties**: [Cursed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak a passphrase known only to the High Command of the Black Iron Pact—"Blood of Rioja"—and choose a target destination. If you are not in the demiplane known as the Cyst, you must choose a destination within the Cyst. If you are already in the Cyst, you must choose a destination you have visited before. Once you choose a destination in this way, the ring teleports you there. The ring can be used to teleport twice and regains both uses daily at dusk.

## Curse

Once you attune to this ring, you can't take it off or end your attunement to it unless you are targeted by a cure ailment power of 4th order or higher or the [greater restoration](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md) spell.
