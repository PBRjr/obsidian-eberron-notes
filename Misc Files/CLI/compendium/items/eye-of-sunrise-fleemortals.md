# Eye of Sunrise
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/FleeMortals/Items/Eye%20of%20Sunrise.webp#right)


A crimson gemstone glitters on the back of this black iron gauntlet. While wearing the gauntlet, you can use a bonus action to cause the stone to shed bright red light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can use another bonus action to extinguish the light.

Additionally, you can use an action to raise the gauntlet and emit a fiery explosion in a 30-foot cone. The explosion can be heard 300 feet away. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d6` fire damage plus `5d6` force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each structure and mundane object in the area that isn't being worn or carried takes `10d6` fire damage plus `10d6` force damage. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
