# Ring of Scarlet Shadows
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  



This iridium ring is inlaid with an obsidian band. The stone inlay occasionally appears to writhe or shift, as if shadows play along its surface.

While wearing this ring, you gain [darkvision](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet, or if you already have [darkvision](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision), its range increases by 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.

## Shadow Blade

You can use a bonus action to extend a blade of shadows from the hand that wears the ring. You can wield the blade as a shortsword that deals necrotic damage instead of piercing damage. While the blade is extended, you can't drop it or hold anything else in that hand. You can dismiss the blade as a bonus action.

## Cursed Sentience

The ring is a sentient and cursed magic item, as described "above".
