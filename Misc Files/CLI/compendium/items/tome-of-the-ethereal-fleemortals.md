# Tome of the Ethereal
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  



Lighter than it rightly should be, this book is always cold to the touch and blurs when seen in periphery. While holding the tome, you can see into the Ethereal Plane out to a range of 120 feet.

In addition, the tome has 3 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dusk. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you targets you with a power, a spell, or an attack while you aren't on the Ethereal Plane, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and choose one of the following effects:

- You enter the Ethereal Plane, then return to the plane and the space you left at the start of your next turn.  

If that space is occupied, you return to the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.

- You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
