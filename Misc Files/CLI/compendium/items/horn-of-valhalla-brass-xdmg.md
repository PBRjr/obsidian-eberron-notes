# Horn of Valhalla, Brass
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/img/horn-of-valhalla.webp#right)


You can take a [Magic](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the Berserker stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [Immunity](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) and [Frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A brass horn summons 3 Berserkers. To use the brass horn, you must have [Proficiency](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md) with all Simple weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned Berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are [Friendly](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/friendly-attitude-xphb.md) to you and your allies and follow your commands.
