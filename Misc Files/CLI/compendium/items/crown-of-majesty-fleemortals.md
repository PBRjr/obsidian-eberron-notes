# Crown of Majesty
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  



This mithral circlet is inscribed with an intricate filigree formed of Elvish runes. The front of the circlet holds a flawless diamond that changes hue in sunlight.

While wearing this crown, you have resistance to psychic damage, and you can't be [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).

The crown has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 18): [command](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/command-xphb.md) or [charm person](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/charm-person-xphb.md). The crown regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.

## Cursed Sentience

The crown is a sentient and cursed magic item, as described "above".
