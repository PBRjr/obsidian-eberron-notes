# Bracers of the Spellbreaker
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  



These mithral bracers are engraved with runes and inlaid with three multicolored bands of tiny gemstones.

While wearing these bracers, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects. In addition, damage from your spell attacks ignore your target's damage resistances.

## Cursed Sentience

The bracers are a sentient and cursed magic item, as described "above".
