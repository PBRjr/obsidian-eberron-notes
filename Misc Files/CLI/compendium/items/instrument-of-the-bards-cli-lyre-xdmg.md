# Instrument of the Bards, Cli Lyre
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/img/cli-lyre.webp#right)


An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play the Cli [Lyre](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/lyre-xphb.md) to cast one of the following spells: [Fly](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/fly-xphb.md), [Invisibility](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/invisibility-xphb.md), [Levitate](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/levitate-xphb.md), [Protection from Evil and Good](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb.md), [Stone Shape](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/stone-shape-xphb.md), [Wall of Fire](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wall-of-fire-xphb.md), and [Wind Wall](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/wind-wall-xphb.md). Once the Cli [Lyre](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/lyre-xphb.md) has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
