# Pendant of Grave Regeneration
*Wondrous item, cursed item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/FleeMortals/Items/Pendant%20of%20Grave%20Regeneration.webp#right)

- **Properties**: [Cursed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

While you wear this pendant, your skin becomes pale and cold to the touch, and you regain 5 hit points at the start of your turn if you have at least 1 hit point.

## Curse

Attuning to this pendant extends its curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a remove curse spell or similar magic, you can't take it off, and your creature type is Undead instead of your normal type.
