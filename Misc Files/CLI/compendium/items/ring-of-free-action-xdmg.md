# Ring of Free Action
*Rare (requires attunement)*  
![](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/img/ring-of-free-action.webp#right)


While you wear this ring, [Difficult Terrain](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce any of your Speeds nor cause you to have the [Paralyzed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [Restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.
