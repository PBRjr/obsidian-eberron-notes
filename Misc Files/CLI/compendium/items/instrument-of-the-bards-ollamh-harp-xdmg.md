# Instrument of the Bards, Ollamh Harp
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/img/ollamh-harp.webp#right)


An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play the Ollamh Harp to cast one of the following spells: [Fly](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/fly-xphb.md), [Invisibility](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/invisibility-xphb.md), [Levitate](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/levitate-xphb.md), [Protection from Evil and Good](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb.md), [Confusion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/confusion-xphb.md), [Control Weather](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/control-weather-xphb.md), and [Fire Storm](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/fire-storm-xphb.md). Once the Ollamh Harp has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
