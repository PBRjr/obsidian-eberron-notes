# Boog's Ball
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  



This magic stone sphere is incredibly dense, has a 3-inch radius, and grows when thrown. As an action, you can throw the ball at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. If you throw the ball 30 feet or less away from you, the ball grows to a 5-foot radius. If you throw the ball farther than 30 feet, it grows to a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the ball's area when it reaches that point must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage. The ball then shrinks back to its 3-inch radius and teleports either into your open hand or into a pack or pouch you wear (your choice).
