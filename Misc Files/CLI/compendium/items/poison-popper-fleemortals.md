# Poison Popper
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/FleeMortals/Items/Poison%20Popper.webp#right)


You can throw this inedible fruit at a point you can see within 60 feet of you, causing it to explode and release a cloud of noxious gas in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The cloud spreads around corners and lingers for 1 minute. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

The cloud's area is lightly obscured, and when a creature enters it for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there, they must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (`4d6`) poison damage and is [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). While [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, a creature's speed is halved. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.
