# Talking Doll
*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)*  
![](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/img/talking-doll.webp#right)


While this doll is within 5 feet of you, you can spend a [Short Rest](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) telling it to say up to six phrases, none of which can be more than six words long, and set a condition under which the doll speaks each phrase. You can also replace old phrases with new ones. Whatever the condition, it must occur within 5 feet of the doll to make it speak. For example, whenever someone picks up the doll, it might say, "I want a piece of candy." The doll's phrases are lost when your [Attunement](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/attunement-xphb.md) to the doll ends.
