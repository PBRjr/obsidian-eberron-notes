# Horn of Valhalla, Bronze
*Wondrous item, very rare*  
![](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/img/horn-of-valhalla.webp#right)


You can take a [Magic](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Magic) action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the Berserker stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [Immunity](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) and [Frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A bronze horn summons 4 Berserkers. To use the bronze horn, you must have training with all Medium armor.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned Berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are [Friendly](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/friendly-attitude-xphb.md) to you and your allies and follow your commands.
