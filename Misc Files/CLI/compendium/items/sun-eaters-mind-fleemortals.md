# Sun Eater's Mind
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/FleeMortals/Items/Sun%20Eaters%20Mind.webp#right)


The shifting shadows within this black glass ring constantly move. While wearing this ring, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes a spell attack against you or casts a spell that requires you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to pierce the creature's mind. The next attack you make against that creature before the end of your next turn is automatically a critical hit. The ring can be used to pierce a creature's mind three times and regains all uses daily at dusk.

## Sun Eater's Gift

While within 30 feet of a willing creature who is attuned to the Sun Eater's soul, you can use a bonus action to swap places with them. The ring can be used to swap places three times and regains all uses daily at dusk.
