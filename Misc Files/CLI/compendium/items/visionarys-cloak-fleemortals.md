# Visionary's Cloak
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/FleeMortals/Items/Visionarys%20Cloak.webp#right)


This gray, hooded traveler's cloak sports a white silk hem and a platinum clasp that, when closed, resembles the shape of an eye.

While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on initiative checks and can't be surprised.

Additionally, when you wear the cloak with the hood up, you gain [truesight](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/senses.md#Truesight) out to a range of 60 feet and your eyes cast a soft blue-white glow. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

## Cursed Sentience

The cloak is a sentient and cursed magic item, as described "above".
