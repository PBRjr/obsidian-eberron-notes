# Pathfinder's Boots
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  



Silver eyelets decorate these soft leather boots. While wearing these boots, you gain a +2 bonus to your AC and your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

The boots have 7 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells from them: [feather fall](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/feather-fall-xphb.md), [jump](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/jump-xphb.md), or [shield](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/shield-xphb.md). The boots regain `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn.

## Cursed Sentience

The boots are a sentient and cursed magic item, as described "above".
