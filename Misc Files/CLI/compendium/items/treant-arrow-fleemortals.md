# Treant Arrow
*Ammunition ([arrow](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/arrow-xphb.md)), uncommon*  


- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs.

This arrow is carved from the boughs of a living [treant](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/plant/treant-fleemortals.md).

When a creature takes damage from the arrow, they are [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by vines that sprout from the shaft. A creature can make a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check as an action, freeing themself or another creature [restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the arrow within their reach on a success.

Once a treant arrow restrains a creature or if the treant used to make the arrow dies, it becomes a mundane arrow.
