# Rod of Resurrection
*Legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*  
![](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/img/rod-of-resurrection.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can cast one of the following spells from it: [Heal](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/heal-xphb.md) (expends 1 charge) or [Resurrection](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/resurrection-xphb.md) (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.
