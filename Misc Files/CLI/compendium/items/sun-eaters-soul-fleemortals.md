# Sun Eater's Soul
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/FleeMortals/Items/Sun%20Eaters%20Soul.webp#right)


This black metal ring is unnervingly matte, reflecting nothing even in the brightest of light. While wearing this ring, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the damage that creature takes from the attack. The ring can be used to halve damage three times and regains all uses daily at dusk.

## Sun Eater's Grace

When you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature, you can also restore that same number of hit points to a creature within 30 feet of you who is attuned to the Sun Eater's mind. The ring can be used to restore hit points three times and regains all uses daily at dusk.
