# Circlet of Blasting
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/img/circlet-of-blasting.webp#right)


While wearing this circlet, you can cast [Scorching Ray](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/spells/scorching-ray-xphb.md) with it (`+5` to hit). The circlet can't cast this spell again until the next dawn.
