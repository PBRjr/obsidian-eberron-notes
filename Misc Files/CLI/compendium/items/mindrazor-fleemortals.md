This rapier was forged using shattered fragments of a powerful psionic crystal and ore from a falling star. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This rapier has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using this weapon, you can expend 1 charge to attempt to inflict a psionic wound. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or become vulnerable to psychic damage for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).
