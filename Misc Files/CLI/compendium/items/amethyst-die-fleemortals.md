# Amethyst Die
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  



This gaming die is carved from a fragment of powerful psionic crystal and resonates with a remnant of its power. This die has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can expend 1 charge to roll a `d6` and add the number rolled to the `d20` roll. Immediately after the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is resolved, you take psychic damage equal to twice the number you rolled on the `d6`.
