![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGiddyLimit/homebrew-img/main/img/FleeMortals/Items/Star%20of%20Iron.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 2d6 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Heavy](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

## (Requires Attunement)

This magic maul is made of a durable, light metal and has a long haft, giving it a reach of 10 feet. When you hit a creature with this maul, they are hexed until the end of their next turn. Whenever a creature hexed in this way makes an attack roll or saving throw, they must roll a `d4` and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

While you hold the maul, you can use an action to change the appearance of its head, choosing its shape and color.
