# Manacles
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 2 gp
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

As a [Utilize](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can use Manacles to bind an unwilling Small or Medium creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the [Grappled](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled), [Incapacitated](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), or [Restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check. While bound, a creature has [Disadvantage](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls, and the creature is [Restrained](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained) if the Manacles are attached to a chain or hook that is fixed in place. Escaping the Manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check as an action. Bursting them requires a successful DC 25 Strength ([Athletics](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check as an action.

Each set of Manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use [Thieves' Tools](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/items/thieves-tools-xphb.md) to pick the Manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check.
