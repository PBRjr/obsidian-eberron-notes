*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 217*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Otyugh Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/aberration/otyugh-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Vile Stench

As a bonus action, you cause your body to expel toxins into the air. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you who needs to breathe must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your exploit save DC or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) and have their speed halved for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
