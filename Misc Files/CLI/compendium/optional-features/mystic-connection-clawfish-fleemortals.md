# Mystic Connection: Clawfish
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 33*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Clawfish Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/clawfish-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Riverkith

You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can breathe lightning in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against your exploit save DC, taking `6d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
