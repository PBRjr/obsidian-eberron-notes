# Bonus Action: Fearsome Growl (1/Day)
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 36*  
**Prerequisite**: Any bear
The bear lets out a mighty growl. Each creature within 15 feet of the bear who can hear them must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the bear until the end of the bear's next turn. A creature who succeeds on their saving throw is immune to the Fearsome Growl of all bears for 24 hours.
