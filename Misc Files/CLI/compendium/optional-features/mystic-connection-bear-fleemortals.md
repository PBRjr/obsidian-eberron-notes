## Ursine Might

As a bonus action, you empower yourself with the strength of a great bear. For the next minute, your Strength-based attacks deal an extra `1d10` damage and you have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
