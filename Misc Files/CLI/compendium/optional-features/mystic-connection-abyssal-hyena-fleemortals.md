# Mystic Connection: Abyssal Hyena
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 123*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Abyssal Hyena Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/fiend/abyssal-hyena-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Rending Teeth

As a bonus action, you can grow your teeth into natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes for 1 minute. You can use Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your teeth, which deal `1d6` + your Strength or Dexterity modifier piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. The first time on a turn that you hit an enemy with this attack, you and your companion regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
