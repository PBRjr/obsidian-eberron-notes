# Mystic Connection: Manticore
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 187*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Manticore Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Spined Skin

As a bonus action, you cause your skin to sprout poisoned spines for 1 minute. For the duration, a creature who touches you or hits you with a melee attack takes 5 (`1d10`) piercing damage, and they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your exploit save DC or be [poisoned](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
