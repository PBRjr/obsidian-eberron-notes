# Mystic Connection: Crawling Claw
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 257*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Crawling Claw Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Crawling Menace

You can use a bonus action to become as nimble on the ground as you are on your feet. For 1 hour, crawling doesn't cost you extra movement, creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, being prone doesn't give other creatures advantage on attacks against you, and being [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone) doesn't give you disadvantage on attacks. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
