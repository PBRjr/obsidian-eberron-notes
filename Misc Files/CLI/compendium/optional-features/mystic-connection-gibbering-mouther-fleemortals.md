# Mystic Connection: Gibbering Mouther
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 115*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Gibbering Mouther Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Chaotic Form

As a bonus action, you channel your companion's chaotic energy into yourself, constantly shifting your form and making you harder to hit. When you use this bonus action and at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, roll a `d6`. Your AC increases by the number rolled until the start of your next turn. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
