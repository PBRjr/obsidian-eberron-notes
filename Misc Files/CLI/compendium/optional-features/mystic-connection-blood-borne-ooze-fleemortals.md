## Oozomorphism

As a bonus action, you become amorphous for 5 minutes, along with any gear you wear or carry. For the duration, you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
