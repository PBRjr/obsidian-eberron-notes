**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Kingfissure Worm Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/kingfissure-worm-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Fissure Force

As an action, you can send tremors through dirt, sand, or solid stone. The area within 30 feet of your current space becomes difficult terrain for enemies for 1 minute. For the duration, an enemy who starts their turn inside this area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your exploit save DC or be knocked prone. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
