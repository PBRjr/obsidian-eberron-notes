As a bonus action, you can bite an enemy as an unarmed strike. You can use Dexterity or Strength for the attack and damage rolls of this attack. On a hit, the strike deals `1d6` + your Dexterity or Strength modifier piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. You can make this attack a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
