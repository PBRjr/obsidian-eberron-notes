# Mystic Connection: Camel
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 46*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Camel Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/camel-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Desert Warrior

You ignore difficult terrain created by dirt or sand, and you are considered naturally adapted to hot climates.

Additionally, you can use a bonus action to activate an aura that shimmers around you like a desert mirage. For 1 minute, you and allies within 10 feet of you have a +PB bonus to Constitution saving throws and saving throws against being [charmed](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [frightened](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
