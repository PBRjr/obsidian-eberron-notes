# Mystic Connection: Wildcat
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 47*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Wildcat Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/wildcat-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Hunt from the Shadow

You gain [darkvision](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/senses.md#Darkvision), its range increases by 60 feet. Additionally, you gain proficiency in the [Stealth](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth) skill if you don't already have it, and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using that skill.
