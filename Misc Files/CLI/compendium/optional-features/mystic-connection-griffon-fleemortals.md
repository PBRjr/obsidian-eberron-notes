# Mystic Connection: Griffon
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 135*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Griffon Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/griffon-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Griffon-Hearted

As an action, you can fly up to twice your walking speed without provoking opportunity attacks. During this movement, you can enter the spaces of other creatures and these spaces don't count as difficult terrain for you. The first time you enter each creature's space during this move, they must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your exploit save DC or take bludgeoning damage equal to your beastheart level and be knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
