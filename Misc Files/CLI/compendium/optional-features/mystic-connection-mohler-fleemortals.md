# Mystic Connection: Mohler
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 125*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Beastheart, [Mohler Companion](Misc%20Files/CLI/compendium/bestiary/beast/mohler-companion-fleemortals.md)
## Earthen Strength

As a bonus action, your limbs grow dense and swing with incredible force for 1 minute. For the duration, when you hit a creature no more than one size category larger or smaller than you with a melee weapon attack, the creature is also knocked [prone](Misc%20Files/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
