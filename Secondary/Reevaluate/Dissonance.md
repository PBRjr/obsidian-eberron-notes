Dissonance is the primal force of change, chaos, and creation. It is the unpredictable spark that spawns new ideas, drives evolution, and creates diversity in all its forms. However, unchecked, it also causes destruction and randomness, ripping apart the fabric of reality and twisting it into impossible shapes.

Dissonance often manifests as spontaneous magical anomalies, unpredictable weather patterns, sudden shifts in local fauna behavior, or the warping and distortion of physical matter. Within its heartland - the [[Mournland]] - the manifestations of Dissonance are more concentrated, creating a landscape that is in constant flux.

Exposure to Dissonance can have various effects on living beings, often causing mutation or spontaneous magical abilities. In sentient beings, Dissonance can inspire creativity, madness, or a sudden desire for change and rebellion. Warped by Dissonance, the common becomes uncommon, the mundane becomes extraordinary, and the predictable becomes capricious.

**Dissonance and Order:** Dissonance and [[Order]] are two sides of the same coin, each necessary to the existence of the other. Where Order seeks to preserve, stabilize, and maintain, Dissonance disrupts, innovates, and provokes evolution. They are intertwined in a perpetual dance of creation and dissolution, each force balancing the other to shape reality. However, with Dissonance now unbound, the balance is severely threatened.

**The Day of Mourning:** Dissonance's unbound release during the [[Day of Mourning]] was a cataclysm of chaotic change. It annihilated [[Cyre]] and left the [[Mournland]] in its wake—a scarred, shifting landscape that defies the natural order. Within this realm, the laws of magic and physics are erratic, creating an environment of both wondrous and terrifying phenomena. [[Order]] used most of its power to seal Dissonance within Cyre, stopping the Mournland's advance towards the entirety of [[Eberron]].

**Symbols and Sigils:** Dissonance might be represented by symbols of flux and change such as a whirlwind, a fire, or a shifting sand dune. Its sigils could be complex fractal patterns that seem to change when viewed from different angles, reflecting its chaotic nature.

**Goal:** Dissonance’s goal is not malevolent—it simply seeks expression and freedom. However, in its unbound state, it threatens to unravel reality itself. The campaign's challenge is to reestablish the balance with Order, allowing Dissonance to continue its role of inspiring change and evolution, but in a way that doesn't risk the integrity of the world.
