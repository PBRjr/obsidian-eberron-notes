Order is the primal force of stasis, permanence, and continuity. It is the binding law that resists change, preferring a state of unchanging stability. It values uniformity, predictability, and the preservation of the status quo at all costs. This makes it neither inherently good nor evil—it simply is.

Order is embodied in the stillness of a rock, the unchanging path of a star, the timeless existence of a desert. Its touch halts the progression of time, making a moment last an eternity. However, without change, nothing new can emerge—no seed can sprout, no idea can be born.

Order's influence can bring rigidity, sameness, and unchanging persistence. It can result in a lack of creativity, unending routines, and stagnation. However, it can also foster stability, peace, and predictability. Its influence is a double-edged sword—valuable for maintaining stability but potentially limiting growth and innovation.

**Post-Day of Mourning:** In reaction to the catastrophic release of [[Dissonance]], Order expended a considerable portion of its power to arrest the spread of chaos, giving rise to the [[Mournland]]. Yet, even this containment field is an unstable compromise, a deviation from Order's preferred state of unchanging stability.

**Order and Dissonance:** Order and Dissonance are counterpoints—without Dissonance, Order would stagnate the world into a state of unchanging preservation, where nothing changes, nothing grows, and nothing dies. Conversely, without Order, Dissonance would tear the world apart with unending change and chaos. Each force tempers the other, forming the delicate balance that allows the universe to exist.

**Symbols and Sigils:** Symbols of Order might include an unbroken circle, an eternal flame, or a perfectly preserved fossil. Its sigils could be repetitive patterns or fractals, reflecting its unchanging nature.

**Goal:** Order’s primary drive is to restore the universe to a state of unchanging stability. Its challenge is to suppress Dissonance without plunging the world into a state of eternal stasis.
