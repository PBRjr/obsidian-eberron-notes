Combat should be two things: fun and dangerous. To accomplish this, the rule of cool will prevail when it comes to using the environment to one's advantage.

Both the player characters and the NPCs may, with a proper and viable explanation, attempt to use the environment in any way to gain an advantage in combat - even if its not explicitly covered in the rules.

Example: Create an improvised breaching charge by putting lit dynamite in a cast iron safe and pointing the open end towards a door/the bad guys. With a high enough skill check(s), you might just succeed. Or it might blow up in your face (literally). Only way to find out is to try!
