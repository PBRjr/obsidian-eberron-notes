## Overview and Tiers
Lifestyle is how each player chooses to live. This is reflected in the type of clothes they wear, where they sleep every night, and how well they take care of themselves. There are several tiers:
- Wretched (0/day): No self care, sleeps on the streets with no cover, wears worn clothing.
- Squalor (5cp/day): Minimal self care, sleeps in abandoned buildings or makeshift tents, worn clothes.
- Modest(5sp/day): Some self care, sleeps in cheap inns or small homes, wears decent or washed clothing.
- Comfortable(5gp/day): Maintains self care, sleeps in moderately prices inns or own home, wears variety of clothing.
- Wealthy(20gp/day): Constantly clean, sleeps in very nice inns or large home, flashy clothing, may have assistants or employees.
- Aristocratic(100gp/day): Extremely well taken care of, sleeps in the most expensive inns or own house/compound, employs a variety of positions.

The price/day next to each tier displays the expected amount of money one would have to spend on things like upkeep, hygiene, clothes, and other things to upkeep that tier of living.
