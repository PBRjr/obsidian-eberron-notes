The rules governing actions that can be taken in combat are strict, especially regarding things like grappling, disarming, and aiming for certain body parts. They are like that for a reason, and I think they certainly have their time and place. However, a strict adherence to these rules can occasionally be a hinderance to an enjoyable and epic combat experience.

That being said, the DM will take a more mellow approach to combat actions. The standard rules still apply, like rolling to hit and for damage. However, actions like aiming for the arms or trying to trip someone can now have a potentially greater effect, given the right skill check.

Keep in mind, this applies to the player characters and all NPCs alike.
