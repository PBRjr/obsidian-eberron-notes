Here are a few potential side quest ideas:\n\n### Side Quest Ideas for Breaking into Boromar HQ\n\n1. **Acquire Disguise Kit**  \n   - **Objective:** Obtain a set of Boromar uniforms and passes to safely access their HQ.\n   - **Idea:** Players need to locate and convince a rogue tailor known in criminal circles to make high-quality disguises. The tailor demands a rare dye from a rival gang's territory as payment.\n\n2. **Disable Surveillance**  \n   - **Objective:** Hack into or disable the surveillance network monitoring the HQ.\n   - **Idea:** A reclusive warforged inventor named Gearshift, who had a falling out with the Boromar, controls the security system. They require a favor to deal with harassment from locals or a broken component the players need to retrieve.\n\n3. **Secure an Ally Inside**  \n   - **Objective:** Turn one of the Boromar insiders to the party’s cause.\n   - **Idea:** A Boromar member secretly opposes their leader's methods. The party must gather dirt on a senior rival to ensure this insider can safely offer help from within.\n\n4. **Gather Intel**  \n   - **Objective:** Learn about shift changes or weaknesses in the HQ defenses.\n   - **Idea:** Players need to break into or negotiate with a librarian at Morgrave University for a book on historical Sharn security layouts, which includes the old Boromar building layout.\n\n5. **Steal a Key**  \n   - **Objective:** Acquire a magical key or artifact necessary to open certain doors within the HQ.\n   - **Idea:** The key is currently possessed by a high-ranking Boromar official living in a luxurious district. The party must choose between a burglary attempt, blackmail, or a high-stakes poker game to win it.\n\n6. **Create a Diversion**  \n   - **Objective:** Orchestrate a significant event elsewhere to pull attention from Boromar HQ.\n   - **Idea:** Cause a commotion or incident at a competing gang's operation that draws Boromar enforcers' attention, making the HQ vulnerable.\n\n### Execution and Integration\n\nThese side quests can involve social interaction, creative problem-solving, or combat, tailored to suit your party's preferences. Each quest should also subtly interweave elements of the campaign’s larger narrative, such as reinforcing connections to the Boromar Clan's goals or revealing additional tidbits about the FKD fragment. By completing these tasks, the players not only prepare themselves for the break-in but also deepen their immersion and investment in the unfolding intrigue.","id":"d040d9a1-5a34-4ca1-9e62-dd8e4d6fe0df","metadata":{"usage":{"prompt_tokens":6150,"completion_tokens":552,"total_tokens":6702,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"model":{"provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o"}}}]}
