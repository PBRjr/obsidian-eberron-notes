Ulfr\n\t- Bjorn & Hrothgar's father\n\t- Former chieftain\n\t- Killed in battle\n- Traust Ulfr\n\t- Bjorn & Hrothgar's mother, clan's oracle\n- Varyn Grayburn\n\t- Is actually the last remaining Couatl\n\t- AKA \"Varyn the Valiant\"\n\t- Joined and became friends with Bjorn's father after his birth\n\t- Was present for Hrothgar's birth while wearing a dragonshard fragment\n\t- Left shortly after once he realized what he had caused\n- Hrothgar Ulfr (Bjorn's brother)\n\t- Was born when a piece of the fractured shard was nearby, tainting his soul\n\t- Slowly gained unnatural (sorcerer-like) powers that use his evil and rage as fuel, increasing the dark cancers hold on him\n\t- Fueled by these emotions and the dark taint on his soul, he led a group of clan members and usurped his brother's rule.\n\t- He eventually killed Draven Flameforge, who came for him to cleanse the land, and the dragonshard fragment he obtained continued fueling his rage and increasing his power.\n\t- His power now noticeably plagues the land.\n- Old Clan members\n\t- Some were enthralled by Hrothgar\n\t- Most others remain loyal to Bjorn\n\t- Ones that didn't leave are forced to hide their disagreement d/t Hrothgar's increasing power.\n- Bjorn's new group\n\t- Whos it composed of?\n\t- Why do they hate Hrothgar\n\t- They don't, Bjorn joined them together via shared ideals\n\t- Some members are former Stormpeak members\n\t- left after Hrothgar takeover\n\n#### PC: Draven Flameforge\n- Byeshk Mountains\n\t- Neighboring Stormpeak Clan\n\t- May have crossed paths after Bjorn was usurped\n- Clan Flameforge\n\t- Founded by Varyn to keep overwatch on the Overlords and oppose the LoD.\n- He worships Siberys along with the clan \n\t- Couatl are a creation of Siberys, along with dragons\n- Trained by Varyn to be a great warrior, Draven took an oath to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber, and to protect the Khyber Dragonshard fragment gifted to him by Varyn.\n- He traveled Khorvaire and fought creatures of Khyber when they popped up.\n- He became a legend, known as the Knight of the North.\n- He eventually found his way to the Stormpeak clan, after Hrothgar had usurped Bjorn.\n\t- Draven could sense the dark cancer on his soul, and tried to vanquish him.\n\t- During their battle, Hrothgar took the dragonshard fragment and used the power it gave him to kill Draven and take the ***Etherseraph***, solidifying the hold Hrothgar had over the Stormpeak Clan.\n\t- Draven's body fell off a cliffside, landing in the snow hundreds of feet below.\n- Varyn found Draven's corpse.\n\t- Varyn used most of his remaining power to heal Draven, but didn't have enough left to return his memories.\n\t- Varyn is now old, weak, and near powerless, filled with a great shame for his many failures in life.\n\n#### PC: Geralt Wolfsbane\n- Yelena & Norbit Wolfsbane\n\t- Geralt's mother and father\n\t- Wolfsbane is Norbit's family name\n\t- They both adopted the d'Cannith name, then later gave it up after they left the house.\n- Parents died when he was young\n\t- Killed by Vorak (prior to transformation) as ordered by Marix d'Cannith.\n- Geralt's parents originally created the first designs of the Steelhardt while they were a part of House Cannith\n\t- It was originally intended to be a way of transferring one's \"soul\" to a new body, effectively producing immortality.\n\t\t- The consciousness was attached to the Steelhardt in a magical ritual\n\t\t- It then had to be implanted into a corpse for the consciousness to then take over.\n\t\t- They created one prototype, combining a Khyber & Siberys shard in the device\n\t\t- It was fully functional as intended, but they never wrote down how they got those two shards to work together.\n\t\t- Cannith Artificer's subsequent attempts to combine the shards in new designs always failed.\n\t- They worked for years refining the designs.\n\t- Marix, working with the LoD, took an interest in these designs for use in creating a sentient warforged army.\n\t\t- Yelena and Norbit found out about Marix's plans and fled House Cannith with all of the designs, hiding with their young son near the Whitehorn Woods.\n- Geralt was snooping in his father's office when he found the designs laid out across his desk.\n\t\t- Being unable to read them, he stole a page that had 'cool' designs and runes on it, also bearing the Gorgon seal of House Cannith.\n\t\t- He still has this page to this day.\n\t\t- A part of why he has learnt so many languages was to decode this page, but he was never able to.\n\t\t\t- It is written in an ancient language that his parents spoke, due to their inherent secrecy (**Sibernyan**)\n\t\t\t- Language was prominently spoken by the Couatl.\n- One night his parents were murdered in their home by Vorak, who stole the prototype schematics. \n- When his parents were killed, he escaped and fled into the woods. He was about 12. He learned to live off the land and was able to survive.\n- He now lives near Shavalant and the Whitehorn Woods.\n\n#### PC: Forge\n- Forge was created in the first batch of modern warforged - and the only one that didn't lose his mind due to his new found form. All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.\n\t- The missing traits being: The soul being transferred MUST have aspects of Khyber & aspects of Siberys fused to the soul to transfer without sanity loss.\n\t- Forge's Steelhardt used Siberys shards as a conduit. In all other warforged in his batch, only having a Siberys shard wasn't enough, since there was no aspect of Khyber attached to their soul/in the Steelhardt.\n\t- Hence why Vorak's transfer was tainted as well. His Steelhardt used a Khyber shard conduit, but there was no aspect of Siberys attached to him.\n\t- Since Forge died in proximity to Lick's father's FKD fragment, an aspect of Khyber attached to his soul, which, in addition to the Siberys Dragonshard conduit in his Steelhardt, meant he retained his memories AND his sanity.\n\t- This information about the missing traits is not currently known **(Vorak stole most of the schematics, however Geralt's schematic is the only one that mentions this requirement.)\n- All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead soldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.\n- Forge was a human general of **House Cannith**\n- In a battle during the last war, he sacrificed his and his men's lives in an explosion he set off to overtake the enemy.\n\t- Lick's father and Woe were in Forge's squad. Forge valued winning the battle/war over the lives of his own men. While Woe and Lick's father were engaged in battle, Forge made the decision to sacrifice himself and his entire squad to blow up and destroy the enemy and win the battle for his side.\n\t- Woe died close to Lick's father's fragment of the *FKD*, causing an aspect of Khyber to latch onto his soul which allowed him to be resurrected into a Warforged body through Mordakhesh's ritual (more details in Woe's backstory)\n- Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and infused into a warforged body. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.\n- Near the end of the war, he broke free and, using his skills from his past life, **destroyed his creation forge**.\n\t- He obtained information on his creation, including the methods that were still being used to create new warforged.\n\t- **He threatened to go public with that [[forge knowledge handout|info]]? (Knowing he would be unable to destroy all of the forges on his own, he forced House Cannith's hand into signing the Treaty of Thronehold and shutting down all creation forges, ending the production of new Warforged?)(Maybe he didn't go public because in the back of his mind he knew one day he may want to \"have children\"? See 'character motivation'.** \n- Warforged were not liberated due to the Treaty of Thronehold. This treaty was a political move so that Forge would not go public with the information he holds on Warforged production and ruin House Cannith's reputation.\n- Due to the ever-looming threat of blackmail, House Cannith has been hunting Forge ever since his escape, attempting to **capture him for further study (probably to continue to attempt to replicate the traits that allowed him to keep his memories)** and eliminate the possibility of that information ever getting out.\n- He was branded with a unique dragonmark on the front of this chest. It contains the House Cannith Gorgan, in addition to markings that read \"FORGE 2\".\n- He learned of **another creation forge in Sharn (How did he find out?)**, explaining his presence outside the lighthouse during his introduction to the campaign in session 5, because he was looking for the teleportation circle inside The Lighthouse.\n- ***Character motivation:***\n\t- Is it unethical to create more in my image? Does that make me a God, or does that make me one of you (normal people)?\n\n#### PC: Sylas Stormshadow (Deceased)\n- Father was an Elven scholar focused on forbidden knowledge about magic\n- Mother was a human merchant in Sharn's Underbelly\n- Learned of eldritch power through his father\n- Made a pact w/ the Traveler in the sewers\n- Would be randomly taken to a different plane for the Traveler's duties\n\n#### PCs: Lox & Nyx Tempest\n* Lox & Nyx are married. They think that they lost their daughter *Elix* in the airship attack at the hands of *Woe*.\n\t*  Elix was supposed to be traveling on the airship back to Nyx's homeland in the forest to spend time with her druidic side of the family.\n* **Lox**\n\t* Lox made a pact with a demon/devil to give Lox the power to enact revenge against his daughter's killer.\n\t\t* ***Lox Secret:***\n\t\t\t* His pact is with *Mordakesh*. Lox has no idea the significance of his patron, but Mordakesh will ensure Lox plays a vital role in releasing his Overlord.\n\t\t\t* **The Contract.**\n\t\t\t\t* Mordakesh approached Lox, which is very rare in the world of warlock patrons.\n\t\t\t\t\t* This happened before their daughter died, so Mordakesh showed Lox a vision of the future, convincing him that Lox would need this power to protect his family.\n\t\t\t\t* The *draconic prophecy* led Mordakesh to Lox, suggesting that he would play a pivotal role in the final part of the plan to resurrect *Rak Tulkesh*.\n\t\t\t\t* The contract is simple: Mordakesh provides Lox with his powers, and in return Lox will owe a single favor that will be redeemed when Mordakesh seems fit.\n\t\t\t\t\t* Failure to perform the favor will result in Lox losing \"what he values most\".\n* **Nyx**\n\t* Nyx is a druid, raised in the forest by her family.\n\t* Nyx starts 'hallucinating' visions of her daughter, perhaps past memories that play out in front of her.\n\t\t* Ex.: she might see a version of her daughter when she was young, who is picking flowers outside and giggling to herself\n\t* These hallucinations could be used to build Nyx's backstory with *Elix*.\n\t* Who is causing these hallucinations? *Kismet*? Why?\n* ***Characters motivation:***\n\t* After learning of the airship crash and *Elix's* probable death, Lox & Nyx embarked on a quest to find and kill her murderer.\n* ***Secret.***\n\t* *Elix* isn't actually dead, because she was never on *The Merkentile*. \n\t* Through visions and secret communications, Mordakhesh contacted Elix and convinced her to join him.\n\t* He convinced Elix that he is fighting to restore the \"natural order\" to the world, to bring nature back to the forefront.\n\t* Elix does truly believe that technology has ruined people, and that going back to more druidic times would be the greater good.\n\t* She now sits beside Mordakhesh, ignorant to his plans.\n\n## Story Plot Pieces\n- #### **Themes**:\n\t- What makes a person good? \n\t- Most villains aren't purely evil, but have their own justifications.\n\t- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?\n\t- If one has only known evil since birth, are they redeemable or can they overcome that nature? \n\n#### Central Tension\n- The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh\n\t- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. \n\t\t- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed\n\t\t- The silver flame caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so\n\t\t- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world\n\n#### Significant Lore\n- The Origin of the Warforged\n\t- Warforged are the man-made reincarnates of the fallen soldiers in the Last War; Their souls were repurposed as weapons in the war that took their lives once already.\n\t- The first few batches of Warforged were created without a 'soul' - mindless automatons that had no self initiative or instinct. They were grunts, they followed orders, but on average they were less effective than a typical soldier.\n\t- Cannith artificers - at the order of Marix d'Cannith - devised a method of transferring the soul of a recently deceased humanoid into the body of a warforged - building on the original *Steelhardt* designs taken from Geralt's parents.\n\n#### Significant NPCs\n\n##### Varyn \"The Valiant\" Grayburn\n- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.\n- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl\n- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame\n- Takes the form of an old man missing his left arm at the shoulder. His true form has a partially missing left wing.\n- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons\n\t- Directly oppose actions of the Lords of Dust\n\t- A small group within felt that Clan Flameforge's scope was too narrow.\n\t- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.\n- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.\n\t- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.\n\t- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.\n\t- The LoD found out and also began a search.\n\t- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.\n\t- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.\n- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.\n- He saw the purity and potential within Draven\n\t- The darkness within the shard never affected him.\n- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:\n\t- The *Etherseraph*\n\t- An *FKD* fragment\n- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber\n\n##### Aeren d'Cannith\n- ***Major Motivation:*** To discover the true process of the creation of Warforged and what changed between  the originals and the modern creations.\n- Was adopted into House Cannith about 20 years ago at the age of 18 y/o as the Youngest Master Artificer (and only Master Artificer without a Mark of Creation) ever named within the house.\n\t- Due to his invention of the ingenious Everbright Lantern\n- He is now the Mentor to Miri, the magewright currently living in Shavelant.\n- He was always very interested in the warforged and their creation.\n- Aeren knew of Geralt's parents before they died, and knew they were very important.\n\t- He didn't know what they were researching, but he knew it was highly classified.\n- He does not know what Geralt's schematics say, but he knows that they were written in an ancient draconic dialect (**Sibernyan**)\n- He has come across a few pages of his own **(figure to what those pages reveal?)** but has not been able to translate them.\n\n#### Artifacts\n##### Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD) & Fragments\n- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.\n\t- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of their location, and have been hunting them down since.\n\t- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.\n- Contains imprisoned essence of Rak Tulkesh\n- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted\n- Who has them\n\t- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment (taken from Lick in session 1)\n\t- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment\n\t- Hrothgar: 1 fragment, obtained from Draven when Hrothgar battled and killed him\n\n##### Etherseraph\n- The Etherseraph was crafted by Varyn following the Silver Flame's creation.\n- In addition to a powerful weapon, the Etherseraph is a tool:\n\t- The white flame of the Etherseraph will clear the fog of the Mourning and light the way to the Gate of the Silver Flame.\n\t- The Gate is the entrance to the pocket dimension that contains the actual Silver Flame.\n- Over the years, Varyn has gifted it to many people he deemed worthy to carry it, the most notable being Tira Miron, who, years ago, used it to reseal an escaped Overlord and become the Voice of the Silver Flame.\n- Draven Flameforge was another that was trained by Varyn, and gifted the Etherseraph to wield in the name of Siberys.\n- It is now in Hrothgar's possession, obtained when he killed Draven in battle.\n\n##### Steelhardt (The Prototype)\n- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.\n- Geralt's parent knew that the transference would only be successful if balance between all 3 *Aspects of the Progenitors* were maintained.\n\t- **Siberys's aspect:** Light, Divinity\n\t- **Khyber's aspect:** Darkness, Impiety\n\t- **Eberron's aspect:** Materialism, Tangibility\n- Any imbalance of these 3 (like only using a Khyber/Siberys shard without the other) would result in an imbalance of the soul, causing psychosis.\n- Yelena and Norbit created a single prototype that worked fully as intended. They combined Siberys and Khyber dragonshards into the device, which allowed those two aspects to be fulfilled.\n\t- They never wrote down how they manage to combine those two shards into a single device. All other attempts made by Cannith Artificers have always failed, and only one shard can be installed without the device failing, which has caused psychosis in almost all subjects it was originally attempted on.\n\t- Cannith artificers developed a work-around to the psychosis issue: They wipe the soul's memories upon transference to the Warforged body.\n- The LoD seek to use a Steelhardt to transfer Rak Tulkesh's essence from the FKD into a living avatar, so that he could be freed from his bonds and reign over Eberron once again (See Woe's plot pieces).\n\n#### Villains\n\n##### Vorak\n- Vorak was House Cannith's most skilled assassin, loyal to the House for most of his life. Originally a half-elf, he served for over a hundred years until his age forced him out of field work, though he remained a top advisor for covert activities within the House.\n- Voluntarily underwent House Cannith's and the Wolfsbane's very first attempt at using a Steelhardt to transfer a soul to another body.\n- The transfer was partially successful, moving Vorak from his original body to a younger, stronger one from a deceased Cannith soldier.\n- While he retained his memories, his mind quickly became plagued with dark thoughts, his grip on reality slipping, his physical abilities changing.\n- Before he lost his mind completely, Marix pointed him towards the Wolfsbanes, whom he killed save for Geralt, who escaped.\n- He went rogue, and was manipulated by Mordakhesh, who focused Vorak's mind to one objective: destroy the Silver Flame.\n- Bolstered by new dark powers infused into his Steelhardt by Mordakesh, he led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.\n\t- His attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, shutting his mind to outside manipulations and causing the Silver Flame to defend itself by unleashing the dead gray mists, causing the Mourning.\n- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, creating \"Rageblight zones\" that empower him and allow him to resurrect his body if he falls.\n- His Khyber-infused Steelhardt causes him to achieve quasi-lichdom through unique means:\n\t- Vorak is fueled by rage energy he harvests from his victims\n\t- He doesn't transfer his consciousness - instead, he corrupts areas with his presence\n\t- Each village he destroys becomes a \"Rageblight zone\" that strengthens him\n\t- When physically \"killed,\" he disperses into rage energy and reforms at the nearest corrupted area\n- Ritual to defeat him:\n\t- The unlocked [[Legacy Stone]] must be used in a rageblight zone, where it will summon and bind Vorak.\n\t- The Legacy Stone will charge, weakening Vorak until it is ready, when it will then release a pulse of radiant energy, completely disabling Vorak and cleansing his soul.\n\t- Vorak will then momentarily be himself again, before his body is released into death, having been bound to an undead existence for so long.\n\n##### Woe (Cass Lockheed)\n- Was originally a human soldier fighting in the Last war under his commanding officer, Forge.\n- During a battle, he was locked into a duel with Lick's father, who wore a fragment of the *FKD* around his neck.\n- During this duel, Forge set off an explosion that completed their objective, but also killed Forge, Woe, Lick's father, and most others that were involved in this battle.\n- Woe's proximity to the fragment of the *FKD* during his death caused his soul to be tainted, keeping him in 'Limbo' after death.\n- Mordakhesh - led by the Draconic Prophecy - resurrected Woe in a profane ritual that stored his soul into the *FKD*, fusing it with the essence of Rak Tulkesh, and containing it in a Warforged body.\n- This gave him dark powers, sourced from Rak Tulkesh's essence, which is trapped within. The only limit to his power being the remaining FKD fragments that are still out in the world.\n- Woe's soul, now heavily influenced by the Overlord of Rage, works fanatically under Mordakhesh's guidance.\n- ***Motivation:***\n\t- Forge's decision to sacrifice himself and all of his men, including Woe, caused Woe to become extremely hateful to the concept of war. He believes that government and the wars they wage make the world a worse place.\n\t- He seeks to reunite all of the *FKD* fragments and use that power to start and finish the war to end all wars, one that will wipe all forms of government from the planet.\n\n##### Mordakhesh\n- Lieutenant to Rak Tulkhesh\n- Commands the Lords of Dust & performed ritual on Woe\n- Has been hunting the FKD fragments for a long time\n\t- Ever since Varyn went looking for them\n- Has been guiding Woe to seek out the *FKD* fragments, telling him they will give him the power to achieve his own goals\n- Mardakhesh has kept a secret from Woe - the reunification of the FKD and its shards will allow Rak Tulkesh to use Woe's soul as a catalyst - destroying Rak Tulkesh's prison and allowing his avatar to once again claim dominion over Eberron, shattering Woe's soul in the process.\n- Woe's soul is simply the begining to the chain reaction that will free Rak Tulkesh. Once the pieces are reunited, the FKD fragment must be ripped from Woe's soul and joined with Elix's (an untouched soul)\n\n##### Hrothgar \n- Bjorn's brother\n- Usurped Bjorn's position as the Chieftian of the Stormpeak Clan\n- Killed Draven and took his fractured dragonshard fragment and white flameblade, further increasing his power and dark influence on the surrounding land.\n- Can only be cleansed of the dark corruption on his soul via use of the [[Legacy Stone]] after Geralt has learned how to use it, similar to the process for Vorak.\n\n#### Factions\n##### House Cannith\n- The leader of Cannith south is Marix d'Cannith.\n- Marix ordered the use of the Steelhardt in the ritual involving Vorack.\n- He also put the hit out on Geralt's parents.\n\n##### Church of the Silver Flame\n- ***Secret***: Doesn't actually know where the Silver Flame is kept.\n- ***Motivation:*** Find the Silver Flame and claim dominion over it, to protect it.\n- Know of the Boromar Clan's attempts to track down Baelin ir'Torn for the dragonshard fragment.\n- Are working with Baelen trying to locate the Silver Flame, giving him their resources.\n\n##### Boromar clan\n- Seeks the Dragonshard and fragments for none other than the promise of wealth and power\n- Have been tracking Baelen ir'Torn\n```\n```Campaign Notes/NPCs/Kismet.md\n*Basirah -- The Wandering Seer*\n\n---\n\n**Kismet** is one of the two Coautl that still remain on Eberron after [[The Great Sacrifice]], the other being [[Varyn]].\n\nKismet presents herself as a frazzled old half-elf woman, with a weak frame and loose skin. She roams Eberron, always appearing where she feels she is most needed. Sometimes she presents herself as a seer needing help with a broken wagon. Other times she's simply an old lady sitting by herself at a campfire. Either way, she always finds her way to those who need her.\n\nBeing a Coautl, Kismet possesses the ability to read the signs of the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. She uses these signs to ensure the right events happen at the right time to prevent the reemergence of the Overlords and to fight the [[Lords of Dust]].\n\nKismet and [[Varyn]] are aware of eachother's existance, though they do not work together.

The Knight's own mind betrays him, a Valiant sacrifice your curse and your savior. Your mind is shrouded in mist, your memories hidden to you. Its barely perceivable, but you know something is very wrong. Its as if a subtle noise that was comforting your ear has suddenly been snuffed out, its absence your only hint at its presence. Will the light of Siberys grant you divine clarity? Or has it already killed the knight, his body not yet informed?\n\nGeralt's reading:\n> The lost child, a wolf born of oak and stone, bird song and a quiet breeze your comfort, your solace, a second home created out of the destruction of another.

Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. \n\n102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. \n\nBlood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.\n\nPowerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. \n\nHouse Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.\n\nWith no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.\n\nThen 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. \n\nThe signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.\n\nStill, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.\n\nOur story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. \n\nDeckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.\n\nThe smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.\n\nA tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. \n\nBjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 1 Recap.md\n# Events (in order)\n1.

The rest of the party, including Lox and Nyx, do their best to break the fall.\n4. They end up in a pool of water in Old Sharn, and see a guard standing over Kazrak, tending to his wounds.\n5. The party encounters the Plague Giant, who kills the guard helping Kazrak.\n6. The party sneaks around the giant, discovering cables that lead to possible ways out.\n7. Draven uses a summoned mastiff to distract the giant, who creates a hole in the wall to the mechanical room that controls the leyline power for the doors out.\n8. The party defeats the giant, then turns on the leyline converters, opening a portcullis.\n9. The party takes a small boat, along with Kazrak, and follows the flowing water through the portcullis and into a dark twisting channel, lit only by Nyx's magical dancing lights.\n\n### Party-collected loot\n* 2 diamonds worth 50 gp\n* 15 gp\n* Bag of holding\n\n### Significant plot events\n* The party saved the life of Kazrak, who even promised them a one-time get-out-of-jail free card should they be jailed in Sharn.\n* The party learned some history about the War of the Mark and the Lady of the Plague through a history check by Nyx.\n\n### Save for later\n* Meeting with the King\n* You're being watched\n* Do another Legacy stone vision at the start of session 12.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 12 Plans.md\nTODO:\n- Agent's of woe encounter?\n### Outline\n- You're being watched (start)\n- [[Legacy Stone]]\n- Mordakhesh's Favor\n- Shamukaar (Kazrak elects to leave)\n\n**Don't Forget:**\n- Kazrak will leave Shamukaar quickly\n### Moments & Encounters\n\n- [ ] Session Start\n\t- While traveling down the narrow water channel, someone in the party feels like they're being watched.\n\t- Woe attempts to scry on Forge.

Colorful flowers blow in the wind. A cloaked figure stands tall with his back to Lox, his hands clasped behind his back. His hands are his only feature not shrouded in a cloak, and they appear to be human.\n\t- Mordakhesh requests a favor from Lox.\n\t\t- *\"During your travels you will encounter a... 'thing' that calls itself Vorak.\" The origin of this creature is of no import, as it is but a shell of its former glory. Normally I would pay no heed to such a disappointment, however within that outer shell lives a... prize.

'Stone can outlast time itself', they would say.* \n\t\t- *What they don't understand is that its not the stone that gives way, allowing intruders into one's castle.

Halak is believed to be somewhere inside the HQ.\n\t\t- Red Cloak Batallion (RCB) airships and foot soldiers are posted out-of-sight and are ready to make entry once the prisoners are secured and the anti-air cannons are destroyed.\n\t\t- Entry will be made shortly before Castar's forces attack, which will be the distraction needed to rescue the prisoners.\n\t\t\n\t- **Primary Objectives**\n\t\t1.

Reason clan wants to control Shavalant:\n\t- Water tower is a unique piece of magitech - knowledge of workings could be worth good money\n\t- Shavalant is along a commonly traveled road - traveling merchants can be easily extorted.\n\n\nPerson 2: Orc 1 & 3\n\n- Dumb and strong.

The effect lasts as long as they are in the mist.\r\n\t- The session can end with the party trapped in the apothecary as enraged townsfolk and bandits begin to scream and fight in the streets outside.\r\n\r\n### Location Details\r\n\r\nPlace 1: _Galethspyre_\r\n- A small fishing village devastated by the Rageblight a few weeks ago. Buildings are collapsing, and a sense of dread hangs in the air.\r\n- **Key Locations:**\r\n\t- *The Gilded Gill Apothecary:* A two-story building, mostly intact but ransacked. The Ghost Spores can be found in a hidden cellar compartment.\r\n\t- *The Broken Mast Tavern:* Now a makeshift base for the Red Hands Gang.\r\n\t- *Town Hall:* Contains records of the town's slow descent into madness before its fall.\r\n\r\n### People\r\n\r\nPerson 1: *Korven Thale*\r\n*Session Information*\r\n- Captured by the party. He is a zealot but not suicidal. He can be interrogated for information on the Church's knowledge of the FKD and their fear of the Lords of Dust.\r\n*Plot Information*\r\n- His capture is a significant blow to the Church's local operations. His superiors will not be pleased and may escalate their methods to retrieve the FKD fragment.\r\n\r\nPerson 2: *Kynes Lawford*\r\n*Session Information*\r\n- A skilled but eccentric healer who is the party's only hope of saving Geralt. He is more interested in rare herbs than politics or danger.\r\n*Plot Information*\r\n- He is unaffiliated with any major faction but his skills are rare and valuable, making him a person of interest to many.\r\n\r\nPerson 3: *Marta Vex*\r\n*Session Information*\r\n- The sole surviving authority figure from Galethspyre. Traumatized but resilient, she can offer tactical information about the town layout, survivor locations, and bandit patrols.\r\n*Plot Information*\r\n- She witnessed the Rageblight's arrival and can describe a large, monstrous figure leading the attack, providing a clue about Vorak's nature.\r\n\r\n### Plot Actions\r\n\r\nAction 1: *Red Hands Gang*\r\n- Goal: Solidify control over Galethspyre and exploit its remaining resources and survivors.\r\n- The gang is fortifying positions within the town and actively hunting down the few remaining townsfolk hiding in the ruins. The party's arrival is an unwelcome complication.\r\n\r\nAction 2: *Vorak's Influence (The Rageblight)*\r\n- Goal: N/A (passive effect)\r\n- The Rageblight zone around Galethspyre acts as a constant environmental threat. The red mist at night will turn the town into a free-for-all warzone, making simple tasks incredibly dangerous and complicating any fight the party gets into.\r\n\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session Index.md\n# Session Index\r\n\r\n*   **Session 1:** The party survives an airship attack by a mysterious figure named Woe, who crashes the ship and steals a necklace from an NPC.\r\n*   **Session 2:** After clearing out a kobold cave and failing to save an NPC, the party loses their companion Sylas in a tragic fall.\r\n*   **Session 3:** The party handles a local monster problem in the town of Shavalant and learns the Boromar Clan is active in the area.\r\n*   **Session 4:** The party raids a Boromar campsite, lets the leader go, and later encounters the enigmatic seer Kismet before finding a skirmish site.\r\n*   **Session 5:** The party investigates a ransacked Church of the Silver Flame outpost, battles disguised demons, and witnesses Woe being empowered by his dark master.\r\n*   **Session 6:** Following a harrowing escape through collapsing tunnels and a lava-filled refinery, the party fights through an undead-infested tower.\r\n*   **Session 7:** Arriving in Sharn, the party meets the artificer Aeren d'Cannith and agrees to investigate the workshop of Geralt's parents.\r\n*   **Session 8:** The party infiltrates the dangerous Wolfsbane Workshop, defeats its guardians, and discovers the powerful Legacy Stone.\r\n*   **Session 9:** Discovering Aeren has been kidnapped, the party investigates clues across Sharn, ultimately confronting Boromar thugs.\r\n*   **Session 10:** The party escapes a warehouse raid by the Sharn Watch, only to be trapped in a collapsing building by their leader.\r\n*   **Session 11:** Plummeting into the depths of Old Sharn, the party defeats a horrifying Plague Giant and escapes through the sewers with their captor, Kazrak.\r\n*   **Session 12:** The party finds refuge in the underground city of Shamukaar, where Geralt has a vision and Lox is contacted by his mysterious patron.\r\n*   **Session 13:** The party accepts a mission from Kazrak to destabilize the Boromar Clan by attacking one of its splinter factions.\r\n*   **Session 14:** During a week of downtime, the party negotiates with the Church of the Silver Flame, and several members receive cryptic personal messages.\r\n*   **Session 15:** The party infiltrates the Boromar Clan's floating headquarters, rescues two prisoners, and is confronted by Woe, who sends the base crashing down.\r\n*   **Session 16:** After surviving the fall of the Boromar HQ, the party finds Aeren's workshop ransacked and is smuggled out of Sharn on a lightning rail.\r\n*   **Session 17:** Bandits ambush the party's train, but are defeated, leading the party to a map pointing towards the Rageblight-devastated town of Galethspyre.\r\n*   **Session 18:** The party travels to Wroat, gets arrested and escapes with their allies, and defeats a Church of the Silver Flame kill squad.\n```\n\n\n@Sessions @Plot Web.md @Kismet.md @Its Kismet.md What might kismet say if she gave new readings to the players next session, including the PCs who never got readings in the first place?\n\n"

Here are some potential new readings from Kismet, incorporating recent events and future plot hooks for all the current PCs.\n\n<smtcmp_block language=\"markdown\">\n### Kismet's Return\n\n**Bjorn's Reading:**\n> The storm you carry has not lessened, has it, son of the mountains? It now rages with the echoes of a fallen kingdom and the cries of a desperate mother. You seek to reclaim a home that is no longer yours, to fight a brother who is no longer himself. Be wary, for the path back is not paved with stone, but with the shards of a terrible legacy. The flame you were forged in may be the only thing that can cauterize the wound... or burn everything you love to ash.\n\n**Draven's Reading:**\n> The Knight of the North wears a familiar face, but the soul behind it is a stranger. You've gathered the pieces of your name, but the picture they form is still shattered. The light you once followed has been stolen, wielded now by the very darkness you were sworn to fight. You search for memories, but perhaps you should be searching for truth. What is a knight without his oath? And what becomes of an oath when its purpose is a lie?\n\n**Geralt's Reading:**\n> The wolf cub who sought answers now carries them within his very being. A mother's love, a mother's knowledge... a mother's curse. The heart of stone beats with a borrowed life, ticking like a clock towards a terrible choice. You run from one death only to race towards another. The path to the mountain peak is clear, but the man who reaches it may not be the same one who started the climb.\n\n**Forge's Reading:**\n> A mind of flesh in a body of steel. You carry the weight of a war you ended and the ghosts of the men you sacrificed. You seek to understand your creation, but do you understand what you have become? A father without children, a soldier without a war. But a new war is coming, and a ghost from your past now wears the face of the enemy. Be careful, lest the very thing you fight to prevent—the creation of more like you—becomes your only salvation.\n\n**Lox's Reading:**\n> You carry a fire fueled by righteous grief, a power granted to avenge a stolen future. But the hand that feeds your flame is cloaked in shadow, and the path to your revenge is paved with deception. You hunt a murderer, but you are blind to the true monster. The favor you owe will come due, and you will learn that the price for power is not paid in gold, but in what you value most. Are you sure you know what that is?\n\n**Nyx's Reading:**\n> The forest weeps with you, mother of a lost child. You see her in the corner of your eye, a memory, a ghost, a warning. Do you trust your sight? Or do you trust your grief? A great deception holds your family in its grasp, and the cure is not in vengeance, but in vision. Look past the veil of what you *believe* to be true, and see the truth that *is*. The child is not gone, merely... misplaced. And the choice her father must make will determine if she is lost forever.\n</smtcmp_block>",
