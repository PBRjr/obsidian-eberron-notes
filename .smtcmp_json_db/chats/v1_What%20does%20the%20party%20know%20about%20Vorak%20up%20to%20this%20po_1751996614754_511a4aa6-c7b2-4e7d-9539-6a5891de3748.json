He can not leave the rageblight zone.\r\n\r\n- During this phase, Vorak will try to break free of the binding.\r\n- Players must protect the Legacy Stone while fighting Vorak.\r\n\r\n**Environmental effect:** \r\n- Pockets of concentrated rage appear as swirling red mist that damage players:\r\n\t- 3d6 psychic damage\r\n\t- 10ft radius\r\n\t- 1 will spawn within 15 feet of each PC. At the start of each round, a pocket will move to the location that it's PC was in at the start of their last turn.\r\n\r\n**Special Actions**:\r\n\r\n- **Barbarous Leap:** Vorak can use his bonus action to jump a distance equal to his speed in the direction of his target, without imposing opportunity attacks.\r\n- **Rage Siphon**: Vorak absorbs nearby rage pockets, healing himself for 2d10 HP per pocket.",

      "content": "From the information provided, the party knows several details about Vorak:\n\n1. **Background and Transformation**: Vorak was House Cannith's most skilled assassin. He underwent an experimental procedure with the Steelhardt to transfer his soul into a new body, resulting in mental instability and dark thoughts (lines 230-234). This experiment partially succeeded, but his mind quickly became plagued.\n\n2. **Connection to Geralt**: Vorak killed the Wolfsbanes save for Geralt, who managed to escape (line 235). This gives Geralt a personal connection and potentially a vendetta against Vorak.\n\n3. **Manipulation by Mordakhesh**: After going rogue, Vorak was manipulated by Mordakhesh, focusing his mind on destroying the Silver Flame. This manipulation was a significant plot point contributing to the Day of Mourning (lines 236-238).\n\n4. **Creation of Rageblight Zones**: Vorak roams, creating \"Rageblight zones\" that empower him. These zones help him resurrect if defeated and are a source of his power due to their corruptive nature (lines 239-243).\n\n5. **Defeating Vorak**: The party must use the unlocked Legacy Stone in a Rageblight zone to summon and bind Vorak. This binding weakens him and eventually allows the party to cleanse his soul, returning him briefly to his original self before his death (lines 245-248).\n\n6. **Fight Mechanics**: During the Vorak boss fight, players will need to protect the Legacy Stone while contending with environmental effects like concentrated rage pockets (lines 14-30). The details of these mechanics might give hints to the party on how they can effectively prepare and combat Vorak.\n\nIn summary, the party knows about Vorak's past with House Cannith, his current rogue status and manipulations by Mordakhesh, his association with the rageblight zones, and the method required to confront and ultimately defeat him.\n\nHere are the referenced blocks that contain the above information:\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Campaign Notes/Story/Plot Web.md\" language=\"markdown\" startLine=\"230\" endLine=\"243\"></smtcmp_block>\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Campaign Notes/Story/Plot Web.md\" language=\"markdown\" startLine=\"245\" endLine=\"248\"></smtcmp_block>\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Campaign Notes/Brainstorms/Vorak Bossfight.md\" language=\"markdown\" startLine=\"14\" endLine=\"30\"></smtcmp_block>",
