Ulfr\n\t- Bjorn & Hrothgar's father\n\t- Former chieftain\n\t- Killed in battle\n- Traust Ulfr\n\t- Bjorn & Hrothgar's mother, clan's oracle\n- Varyn Grayburn\n\t- Is actually the last remaining Couatl\n\t- AKA \"Varyn the Valiant\"\n\t- Joined and became friends with Bjorn's father after his birth\n\t- Was present for Hrothgar's birth while wearing a dragonshard fragment\n\t- Left shortly after once he realized what he had caused\n- Hrothgar Ulfr (Bjorn's brother)\n\t- Was born when a piece of the fractured shard was nearby, tainting his soul\n\t- Slowly gained unnatural (sorcerer-like) powers that use his evil and rage as fuel, increasing the dark cancers hold on him\n\t- Fueled by these emotions and the dark taint on his soul, he led a group of clan members and usurped his brother's rule.\n\t- He eventually killed Draven Flameforge, who came for him to cleanse the land, and the dragonshard fragment he obtained continued fueling his rage and increasing his power.\n\t- His power now noticeably plagues the land.\n- Old Clan members\n\t- Some were enthralled by Hrothgar\n\t- Most others remain loyal to Bjorn\n\t- Ones that didn't leave are forced to hide their disagreement d/t Hrothgar's increasing power.\n- Bjorn's new group\n\t- Whos it composed of?\n\t- Why do they hate Hrothgar\n\t- They don't, Bjorn joined them together via shared ideals\n\t- Some members are former Stormpeak members\n\t- left after Hrothgar takeover\n\n#### PC: Draven Flameforge\n- Byeshk Mountains\n\t- Neighboring Stormpeak Clan\n\t- May have crossed paths after Bjorn was usurped\n- Clan Flameforge\n\t- Founded by Varyn to keep overwatch on the Overlords and oppose the LoD.\n- He worships Siberys along with the clan \n\t- Couatl are a creation of Siberys, along with dragons\n- Trained by Varyn to be a great warrior, Draven took an oath to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber, and to protect the Khyber Dragonshard fragment gifted to him by Varyn.\n- He traveled Khorvaire and fought creatures of Khyber when they popped up.\n- He became a legend, known as the Knight of the North.\n- He eventually found his way to the Stormpeak clan, after Hrothgar had usurped Bjorn.\n\t- Draven could sense the dark cancer on his soul, and tried to vanquish him.\n\t- During their battle, Hrothgar took the dragonshard fragment and used the power it gave him to kill Draven and take the ***Etherseraph***, solidifying the hold Hrothgar had over the Stormpeak Clan.\n\t- Draven's body fell off a cliffside, landing in the snow hundreds of feet below.\n- Varyn found Draven's corpse.\n\t- Varyn used most of his remaining power to heal Draven, but didn't have enough left to return his memories.\n\t- Varyn is now old, weak, and near powerless, filled with a great shame for his many failures in life.\n\n#### PC: Geralt Wolfsbane\n- Yelena & Norbit Wolfsbane\n\t- Geralt's mother and father\n\t- Wolfsbane is Norbit's family name\n\t- They both adopted the d'Cannith name, then later gave it up after they left the house.\n- Parents died when he was young\n\t- Killed by Vorak (prior to transformation) as ordered by Marix d'Cannith.\n- Geralt's parents originally created the first designs of the Steelhardt while they were a part of House Cannith\n\t- It was originally intended to be a way of transferring one's \"soul\" to a new body, effectively producing immortality.\n\t\t- The consciousness was attached to the Steelhardt in a magical ritual\n\t\t- It then had to be implanted into a corpse for the consciousness to then take over.\n\t\t- They created one prototype, combining a Khyber & Siberys shard in the device\n\t\t- It was fully functional as intended, but they never wrote down how they got those two shards to work together.\n\t\t- Cannith Artificer's subsequent attempts to combine the shards in new designs always failed.\n\t- They worked for years refining the designs.\n\t- Marix, working with the LoD, took an interest in these designs for use in creating a sentient warforged army.\n\t\t- Yelena and Norbit found out about Marix's plans and fled House Cannith with all of the designs, hiding with their young son near the Whitehorn Woods.\n- Geralt was snooping in his father's office when he found the designs laid out across his desk.\n\t\t- Being unable to read them, he stole a page that had 'cool' designs and runes on it, also bearing the Gorgon seal of House Cannith.\n\t\t- He still has this page to this day.\n\t\t- A part of why he has learnt so many languages was to decode this page, but he was never able to.\n\t\t\t- It is written in an ancient language that his parents spoke, due to their inherent secrecy (**Sibernyan**)\n\t\t\t- Language was prominently spoken by the Couatl.\n- One night his parents were murdered in their home by Vorak, who stole the prototype schematics. \n- When his parents were killed, he escaped and fled into the woods. He was about 12. He learned to live off the land and was able to survive.\n- He now lives near Shavalant and the Whitehorn Woods.\n\n#### PC: Forge\n- Forge was created in the first batch of modern warforged - and the only one that didn't lose his mind due to his new found form. All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.\n\t- The missing traits being: The soul being transferred MUST have aspects of Khyber & aspects of Siberys fused to the soul to transfer without sanity loss.\n\t- Forge's Steelhardt used Siberys shards as a conduit. In all other warforged in his batch, only having a Siberys shard wasn't enough, since there was no aspect of Khyber attached to their soul/in the Steelhardt.\n\t- Hence why Vorak's transfer was tainted as well. His Steelhardt used a Khyber shard conduit, but there was no aspect of Siberys attached to him.\n\t- Since Forge died in proximity to Lick's father's FKD fragment, an aspect of Khyber attached to his soul, which, in addition to the Siberys Dragonshard conduit in his Steelhardt, meant he retained his memories AND his sanity.\n\t- This information about the missing traits is not currently known **(Vorak stole most of the schematics, however Geralt's schematic is the only one that mentions this requirement.)\n- All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead soldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.\n- Forge was a human general of **House Cannith**\n- In a battle during the last war, he sacrificed his and his men's lives in an explosion he set off to overtake the enemy.\n\t- Lick's father and Woe were in Forge's squad. Forge valued winning the battle/war over the lives of his own men. While Woe and Lick's father were engaged in battle, Forge made the decision to sacrifice himself and his entire squad to blow up and destroy the enemy and win the battle for his side.\n\t- Woe died close to Lick's father's fragment of the *FKD*, causing an aspect of Khyber to latch onto his soul which allowed him to be resurrected into a Warforged body through Mordakhesh's ritual (more details in Woe's backstory)\n- Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and infused into a warforged body. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.\n- Near the end of the war, he broke free and, using his skills from his past life, **destroyed his creation forge**.\n\t- He obtained information on his creation, including the methods that were still being used to create new warforged.\n\t- **He threatened to go public with that [[forge knowledge handout|info]]? (Knowing he would be unable to destroy all of the forges on his own, he forced House Cannith's hand into signing the Treaty of Thronehold and shutting down all creation forges, ending the production of new Warforged?)(Maybe he didn't go public because in the back of his mind he knew one day he may want to \"have children\"? See 'character motivation'.** \n- Warforged were not liberated due to the Treaty of Thronehold. This treaty was a political move so that Forge would not go public with the information he holds on Warforged production and ruin House Cannith's reputation.\n- Due to the ever-looming threat of blackmail, House Cannith has been hunting Forge ever since his escape, attempting to **capture him for further study (probably to continue to attempt to replicate the traits that allowed him to keep his memories)** and eliminate the possibility of that information ever getting out.\n- He was branded with a unique dragonmark on the front of this chest. It contains the House Cannith Gorgan, in addition to markings that read \"FORGE 2\".\n- He learned of **another creation forge in Sharn (How did he find out?)**, explaining his presence outside the lighthouse during his introduction to the campaign in session 5, because he was looking for the teleportation circle inside The Lighthouse.\n- ***Character motivation:***\n\t- Is it unethical to create more in my image? Does that make me a God, or does that make me one of you (normal people)?\n\n#### PC: Sylas Stormshadow (Deceased)\n- Father was an Elven scholar focused on forbidden knowledge about magic\n- Mother was a human merchant in Sharn's Underbelly\n- Learned of eldritch power through his father\n- Made a pact w/ the Traveler in the sewers\n- Would be randomly taken to a different plane for the Traveler's duties\n\n#### PCs: Lox & Nyx Tempest\n* Lox & Nyx are married. They think that they lost their daughter *Elix* in the airship attack at the hands of *Woe*.\n\t*  Elix was supposed to be traveling on the airship back to Nyx's homeland in the forest to spend time with her druidic side of the family.\n* **Lox**\n\t* Lox made a pact with a demon/devil to give Lox the power to enact revenge against his daughter's killer.\n\t\t* ***Lox Secret:***\n\t\t\t* His pact is with *Mordakesh*. Lox has no idea the significance of his patron, but Mordakesh will ensure Lox plays a vital role in releasing his Overlord.\n\t\t\t* **The Contract.**\n\t\t\t\t* Mordakesh approached Lox, which is very rare in the world of warlock patrons.\n\t\t\t\t\t* This happened before their daughter died, so Mordakesh showed Lox a vision of the future, convincing him that Lox would need this power to protect his family.\n\t\t\t\t* The *draconic prophecy* led Mordakesh to Lox, suggesting that he would play a pivotal role in the final part of the plan to resurrect *Rak Tulkesh*.\n\t\t\t\t* The contract is simple: Mordakesh provides Lox with his powers, and in return Lox will owe a single favor that will be redeemed when Mordakesh seems fit.\n\t\t\t\t\t* Failure to perform the favor will result in Lox losing \"what he values most\".\n* **Nyx**\n\t* Nyx is a druid, raised in the forest by her family.\n\t* Nyx starts 'hallucinating' visions of her daughter, perhaps past memories that play out in front of her.\n\t\t* Ex.: she might see a version of her daughter when she was young, who is picking flowers outside and giggling to herself\n\t* These hallucinations could be used to build Nyx's backstory with *Elix*.\n\t* Who is causing these hallucinations? *Kismet*? Why?\n* ***Characters motivation:***\n\t* After learning of the airship crash and *Elix's* probable death, Lox & Nyx embarked on a quest to find and kill her murderer.\n* ***Secret.***\n\t* *Elix* isn't actually dead, because she was never on *The Merkentile*. \n\t* Through visions and secret communications, Mordakhesh contacted Elix and convinced her to join him.\n\t* He convinced Elix that he is fighting to restore the \"natural order\" to the world, to bring nature back to the forefront.\n\t* Elix does truly believe that technology has ruined people, and that going back to more druidic times would be the greater good.\n\t* She now sits beside Mordakhesh, ignorant to his plans.\n\n## Story Plot Pieces\n- #### **Themes**:\n\t- What makes a person good? \n\t- Most villains aren't purely evil, but have their own justifications.\n\t- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?\n\t- If one has only known evil since birth, are they redeemable or can they overcome that nature? \n\n#### Central Tension\n- The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh\n\t- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. \n\t\t- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed\n\t\t- The silver flame caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so\n\t\t- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world\n\n#### Significant Lore\n- The Origin of the Warforged\n\t- Warforged are the man-made reincarnates of the fallen soldiers in the Last War; Their souls were repurposed as weapons in the war that took their lives once already.\n\t- The first few batches of Warforged were created without a 'soul' - mindless automatons that had no self initiative or instinct. They were grunts, they followed orders, but on average they were less effective than a typical soldier.\n\t- Cannith artificers - at the order of Marix d'Cannith - devised a method of transferring the soul of a recently deceased humanoid into the body of a warforged - building on the original *Steelhardt* designs taken from Geralt's parents.\n\n#### Significant NPCs\n\n##### Varyn \"The Valiant\" Grayburn\n- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.\n- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl\n- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame\n- Takes the form of an old man missing his left arm at the shoulder. His true form has a partially missing left wing.\n- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons\n\t- Directly oppose actions of the Lords of Dust\n\t- A small group within felt that Clan Flameforge's scope was too narrow.\n\t- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.\n- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.\n\t- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.\n\t- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.\n\t- The LoD found out and also began a search.\n\t- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.\n\t- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.\n- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.\n- He saw the purity and potential within Draven\n\t- The darkness within the shard never affected him.\n- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:\n\t- The *Etherseraph*\n\t- An *FKD* fragment\n- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber\n\n##### Aeren d'Cannith\n- ***Major Motivation:*** To discover the true process of the creation of Warforged and what changed between  the originals and the modern creations.\n- Was adopted into House Cannith about 20 years ago at the age of 18 y/o as the Youngest Master Artificer (and only Master Artificer without a Mark of Creation) ever named within the house.\n\t- Due to his invention of the ingenious Everbright Lantern\n- He is now the Mentor to Miri, the magewright currently living in Shavelant.\n- He was always very interested in the warforged and their creation.\n- Aeren knew of Geralt's parents before they died, and knew they were very important.\n\t- He didn't know what they were researching, but he knew it was highly classified.\n- He does not know what Geralt's schematics say, but he knows that they were written in an ancient draconic dialect (**Sibernyan**)\n- He has come across a few pages of his own **(figure to what those pages reveal?)** but has not been able to translate them.\n\n#### Artifacts\n##### Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD) & Fragments\n- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.\n\t- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of their location, and have been hunting them down since.\n\t- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.\n- Contains imprisoned essence of Rak Tulkesh\n- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted\n- Who has them\n\t- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment (taken from Lick in session 1)\n\t- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment\n\t- Hrothgar: 1 fragment, obtained from Draven when Hrothgar battled and killed him\n\n##### Etherseraph\n- The Etherseraph was crafted by Varyn following the Silver Flame's creation.\n- In addition to a powerful weapon, the Etherseraph is a tool:\n\t- The white flame of the Etherseraph will clear the fog of the Mourning and light the way to the Gate of the Silver Flame.\n\t- The Gate is the entrance to the pocket dimension that contains the actual Silver Flame.\n- Over the years, Varyn has gifted it to many people he deemed worthy to carry it, the most notable being Tira Miron, who, years ago, used it to reseal an escaped Overlord and become the Voice of the Silver Flame.\n- Draven Flameforge was another that was trained by Varyn, and gifted the Etherseraph to wield in the name of Siberys.\n- It is now in Hrothgar's possession, obtained when he killed Draven in battle.\n\n##### Steelhardt (The Prototype)\n- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.\n- Geralt's parent knew that the transference would only be successful if balance between all 3 *Aspects of the Progenitors* were maintained.\n\t- **Siberys's aspect:** Light, Divinity\n\t- **Khyber's aspect:** Darkness, Impiety\n\t- **Eberron's aspect:** Materialism, Tangibility\n- Any imbalance of these 3 (like only using a Khyber/Siberys shard without the other) would result in an imbalance of the soul, causing psychosis.\n- Yelena and Norbit created a single prototype that worked fully as intended. They combined Siberys and Khyber dragonshards into the device, which allowed those two aspects to be fulfilled.\n\t- They never wrote down how they manage to combine those two shards into a single device. All other attempts made by Cannith Artificers have always failed, and only one shard can be installed without the device failing, which has caused psychosis in almost all subjects it was originally attempted on.\n\t- Cannith artificers developed a work-around to the psychosis issue: They wipe the soul's memories upon transference to the Warforged body.\n- The LoD seek to use a Steelhardt to transfer Rak Tulkesh's essence from the FKD into a living avatar, so that he could be freed from his bonds and reign over Eberron once again (See Woe's plot pieces).\n\n#### Villains\n\n##### Vorak\n- Vorak was House Cannith's most skilled assassin, loyal to the House for most of his life. Originally a half-elf, he served for over a hundred years until his age forced him out of field work, though he remained a top advisor for covert activities within the House.\n- Voluntarily underwent House Cannith's and the Wolfsbane's very first attempt at using a Steelhardt to transfer a soul to another body.\n- The transfer was partially successful, moving Vorak from his original body to a younger, stronger one from a deceased Cannith soldier.\n- While he retained his memories, his mind quickly became plagued with dark thoughts, his grip on reality slipping, his physical abilities changing.\n- Before he lost his mind completely, Marix pointed him towards the Wolfsbanes, whom he killed save for Geralt, who escaped.\n- He went rogue, and was manipulated by Mordakhesh, who focused Vorak's mind to one objective: destroy the Silver Flame.\n- Bolstered by new dark powers infused into his Steelhardt by Mordakesh, he led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.\n\t- His attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, shutting his mind to outside manipulations and causing the Silver Flame to defend itself by unleashing the dead gray mists, causing the Mourning.\n- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, creating \"Rageblight zones\" that empower him and allow him to resurrect his body if he falls.\n- His Khyber-infused Steelhardt causes him to achieve quasi-lichdom through unique means:\n\t- Vorak is fueled by rage energy he harvests from his victims\n\t- He doesn't transfer his consciousness - instead, he corrupts areas with his presence\n\t- Each village he destroys becomes a \"Rageblight zone\" that strengthens him\n\t- When physically \"killed,\" he disperses into rage energy and reforms at the nearest corrupted area\n- Ritual to defeat him:\n\t- The unlocked [[Legacy Stone]] must be used in a rageblight zone, where it will summon and bind Vorak.\n\t- The Legacy Stone will charge, weakening Vorak until it is ready, when it will then release a pulse of radiant energy, completely disabling Vorak and cleansing his soul.\n\t- Vorak will then momentarily be himself again, before his body is released into death, having been bound to an undead existence for so long.\n\n##### Woe (Cass Lockheed)\n- Was originally a human soldier fighting in the Last war under his commanding officer, Forge.\n- During a battle, he was locked into a duel with Lick's father, who wore a fragment of the *FKD* around his neck.\n- During this duel, Forge set off an explosion that completed their objective, but also killed Forge, Woe, Lick's father, and most others that were involved in this battle.\n- Woe's proximity to the fragment of the *FKD* during his death caused his soul to be tainted, keeping him in 'Limbo' after death.\n- Mordakhesh - led by the Draconic Prophecy - resurrected Woe in a profane ritual that stored his soul into the *FKD*, fusing it with the essence of Rak Tulkesh, and containing it in a Warforged body.\n- This gave him dark powers, sourced from Rak Tulkesh's essence, which is trapped within. The only limit to his power being the remaining FKD fragments that are still out in the world.\n- Woe's soul, now heavily influenced by the Overlord of Rage, works fanatically under Mordakhesh's guidance.\n- ***Motivation:***\n\t- Forge's decision to sacrifice himself and all of his men, including Woe, caused Woe to become extremely hateful to the concept of war. He believes that government and the wars they wage make the world a worse place.\n\t- He seeks to reunite all of the *FKD* fragments and use that power to start and finish the war to end all wars, one that will wipe all forms of government from the planet.\n\n##### Mordakhesh\n- Lieutenant to Rak Tulkhesh\n- Commands the Lords of Dust & performed ritual on Woe\n- Has been hunting the FKD fragments for a long time\n\t- Ever since Varyn went looking for them\n- Has been guiding Woe to seek out the *FKD* fragments, telling him they will give him the power to achieve his own goals\n- Mardakhesh has kept a secret from Woe - the reunification of the FKD and its shards will allow Rak Tulkesh to use Woe's soul as a catalyst - destroying Rak Tulkesh's prison and allowing his avatar to once again claim dominion over Eberron, shattering Woe's soul in the process.\n- Woe's soul is simply the begining to the chain reaction that will free Rak Tulkesh. Once the pieces are reunited, the FKD fragment must be ripped from Woe's soul and joined with Elix's (an untouched soul)\n\n##### Hrothgar \n- Bjorn's brother\n- Usurped Bjorn's position as the Chieftian of the Stormpeak Clan\n- Killed Draven and took his fractured dragonshard fragment and white flameblade, further increasing his power and dark influence on the surrounding land.\n- Can only be cleansed of the dark corruption on his soul via use of the [[Legacy Stone]] after Geralt has learned how to use it, similar to the process for Vorak.\n\n#### Factions\n##### House Cannith\n- The leader of Cannith south is Marix d'Cannith.\n- Marix ordered the use of the Steelhardt in the ritual involving Vorack.\n- He also put the hit out on Geralt's parents.\n\n##### Church of the Silver Flame\n- ***Secret***: Doesn't actually know where the Silver Flame is kept.\n- ***Motivation:*** Find the Silver Flame and claim dominion over it, to protect it.\n- Know of the Boromar Clan's attempts to track down Baelin ir'Torn for the dragonshard fragment.\n- Are working with Baelen trying to locate the Silver Flame, giving him their resources.\n\n##### Boromar clan\n- Seeks the Dragonshard and fragments for none other than the promise of wealth and power\n- Have been tracking Baelen ir'Torn\n```\n\n\n@Plot Web.md Can you do a continuity check on this plotweb?\n\n"

The Shard that Tainted Hrothgar\n\nThere is a conflict regarding the dragonshard that first tainted Hrothgar.\n\n*   Varyn's backstory states he found only a single **FKD fragment**, which he later gave to Draven.\n*   Bjorn's backstory says Hrothgar was tainted at birth by \"a piece of the fractured shard\" that Varyn was wearing.\n\nThis suggests Varyn had two FKD fragments, but his own story contradicts this. To resolve this, I suggest clarifying that the first shard was a standard Khyber Dragonshard, and the FKD fragment Hrothgar took from Draven amplified his corruption.\n\nHere is a suggested edit for Bjorn's backstory:\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Campaign Notes/Story/Plot Web.md\" language=\"markdown\">\n<!-- ... existing content ... -->\n- Hrothgar Ulfr (Bjorn's brother)\n\t- Was born when a Khyber Dragonshard fragment Varyn possessed was nearby, tainting his soul.\n\t- Slowly gained unnatural (sorcerer-like) powers that use his evil and rage as fuel, increasing the dark cancer's hold on him.\n<!-- ... existing content ... -->\n</smtcmp_block>\n\n### 2. Mordakhesh's Final Ritual\n\nThe description of the ritual to free Rak Tulkhesh seems to have two conflicting outcomes for Woe's soul. It first states Woe's soul is the catalyst, then says the shard must be ripped from him and joined with Elix.\n\nClarifying this as a multi-step process makes the plan clearer and offers more opportunities for the players to intervene.\n\nHere is a suggested edit for Mordakhesh's plan:\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Campaign Notes/Story/Plot Web.md\" language=\"markdown\">\n<!-- ... existing content ... -->\n##### Mordakhesh\n<!-- ... existing content ... -->\n- Has been guiding Woe to seek out the *FKD* fragments, telling him they will give him the power to achieve his own goals\n- Mardakhesh has kept a secret from Woe. The reunification of the FKD is merely the first step. Once the shard is whole, Mordakhesh plans a second ritual:\n\t- The complete FKD must be ripped from Woe's body, which will shatter his soul.\n\t- It must then be fused with an untouched soul—Elix's—to create a perfect vessel.\n\t- This process will destroy Rak Tulkhesh's prison, allowing his avatar to possess the new vessel and once again reign over Eberron.\n<!-- ... existing content ... -->\n</smtcmp_block>\n\n### Minor Points\n\n*   In Forge's backstory and the Artifacts section, the PC **Lox** is referred to as \"Lick\". You may want to standardize the name.\n*   Your notes to yourself (e.g., \"How did he find out?\", \"figure to what those pages reveal?\") are excellent starting points for developing new plot hooks and session ideas.",
