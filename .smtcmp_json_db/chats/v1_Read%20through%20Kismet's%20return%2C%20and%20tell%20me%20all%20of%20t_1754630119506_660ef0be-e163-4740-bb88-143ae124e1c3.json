Each fiend, from the minor rakshasas roaming the material plane to the formidable overlords shackled in Khyber, occupies a distinct niche within their fiery domain. This hierarchy, while seemingly rigid, is propelled by a constant undercurrent of ambition and subterfuge, as each entity vies for power, influence, and the opportunity to extend their reach beyond their infernal confines.\n\nCentral to the social dynamics of Fernia's denizens is the manipulation of mortal desires and fears through pacts and bargains. These agreements, etched in the essence of the plane itself, are not mere exchanges but pivotal events that can alter the fate of realms. Fiends, with their unparalleled cunning, craft these pacts to ensnare the unwary, trading momentary boons for eternal servitude or influence. Such transactions underscore the fiends' understanding of value, power, and the lengths to which they will go to achieve their ends. Through the lens of these interactions, \"In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology\" sheds light on the intricate dance of dominance and dependence that defines the existence of Eberron's most malevolent beings.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Lore/Mordakhesh's request of Lox.md\n*\"During your travels you will encounter a...

RESULT: Seedling developed purple veining. Grew 3× normal rate but stems twisted unnaturally. Pollen causes sneezing fits and burning sensation in chest when inhaled.\n\n  \n\nTest #8: Common rat expired 5cm from fragment. RESULT: No observable changes, see Test #8.2.\n\n  \n\nTest #8.1: Common healthy rat placed in tank 5-20cm away from fragment. RESULT: No observable changes.\n\n  \n\nTest #8.2: Expired common rat from test #8 resurrected with Aundarian Institute Approved (AIA) revivify scroll 47 seconds post-expiration.

This landmark agreement signals the end of the Last War that has plagued our continent for over a century.\n\nThe signing ceremony took place in Thronehold Castle, the former seat of Galifar's power. Representatives from each of the twelve recognized nations set aside their bitterness and assembled to formally declare an end to hostilities. \n\nThe Treaty delineates boundaries and acknowledges sovereignty, granting each nation its rightfully earned autonomy. These nations include Aundair, Breland, Cyre - now mournfully referred to as The Mournland - Darguun, Droaam, The Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, The Lhazaar Principalities, The Mror Holds, Q'Barra, The Talenta Plains and Thrane.\n\nThe agreement also declares that House Cannith will dismantle Creation Forges across Khorvaire and cease Warforged production henceforth. This clause aims to prevent any future escalation of conflict by stemming the creation of magically manufactured soldiers.\n\nFurthermore, it recognizes Warforged as sentient beings with rights equal to those enjoyed by other denizens of Khorvaire. This groundbreaking recognition marks a progressive step in our continent's history.\n\nHowever, the treaty leaves several contentious issues unresolved. Notably absent are provisions addressing war reparations or specific terms for demilitarization. Additionally, several regions and factions remain unrecognized by the Treaty; this includes Shadow Marches and Valenar who argue for their sovereignty.\n\nWhile critics express concerns over these omissions potentially sowing seeds for future conflicts; optimists view this as an opportunity for continuing diplomatic negotiations in a newfound atmosphere of peace.\n\nThe Treaty signifies not only an end but also a new beginning – a chance for our war-torn continent to heal its wounds and move towards unity and prosperity. It is indeed a monumental milestone in Khorvaire’s history which we should all cherish cautiously while working towards establishing lasting peace.\n\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Lore/Sharn Inquisitor Newspaper/EXPLOSION ROCKS LOWER DURA BOROMAR CLAN.md\n*It was like thunder inside my skull! -Drel Tulloch, witness*\n*Author: Jalana Varan, Special Correspondent*\n\nA tremendous explosion rocked the Callestan district of Lower Dura last night, leaving a warehouse in ruins and citizens scrambling for answers. The building, long suspected by locals to be a processing facility for dreamlily, was reduced to rubble in what authorities are calling a \"deliberate attack.\"  \n  \nWitnesses report seeing several individuals fleeing the scene just moments before the detonation. Among them was reportedly a hulking warforged, a dragonborn, and several other armed individuals whose identities remain unknown.  \n  \n\"It was like thunder inside my skull,\" said Drel Tulloch, a tavern owner whose establishment stands across the street from the blast site. \"The whole building just lit up purple for a second, and then—boom! Gone. Nearly took my front door off its hinges.\"  \n  \nMore concerning are reports that members of the Sharn Watch were present at the scene prior to the explosion. Sources close to the investigation suggest that the notorious Red Cloak Battalion, led by the hobgoblin commander Kazrak the Unyielding, had been conducting surveillance on the facility for several days.  \n  \n\"This has all the hallmarks of an operation gone wrong,\" commented retired Watch Captain Yorin d'Deneith, who reviewed details of the incident for the Inquisitor. \"The timing, the presence of law enforcement, and the complete destruction of evidence point to either spectacular incompetence or something more sinister.\"  \n  \nThe warehouse was allegedly under the control of the Boromar Clan, whose involvement in the dreamlily trade is one of Sharn's worst-kept secrets. Tensions between the clan and Kazrak's forces have escalated in recent months, with several violent confrontations reported throughout the lower wards.  \n  \nMost troubling are unconfirmed reports that the explosion was followed by the collapse of a nearby tower section, sending debris raining down into the depths of Old Sharn. The Watch has cordoned off several streets in the area, citing \"structural concerns,\" but has declined to confirm casualties.  \n  \nCity Councilor Killik Roole has demanded a full investigation into the incident: \"If the Watch is engaging in vigilante tactics that endanger our citizens, the Council must be informed immediately.\"  \n  \nThe Boromar Clan has not issued any official statement regarding the explosion, though several known associates have been seen entering and leaving their headquarters in Middle Central.  \n  \nThe Sharn Inquisitor will continue to investigate this developing story.  \n  \nFor more on the ongoing conflict between the Boromar Clan and law enforcement, see page 7.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Lore/Sharn Inquisitor Newspaper/Mysterious Calamities Plague Outlying Settlements.md\nSHARN INQUISITOR\nAuthor: Notum Harek\n\nIn recent weeks, reports of inexplicable devastation have trickled in from several small towns and villages across Breland and neighboring regions. Eyewitness accounts describe scenes of utter destruction, with buildings reduced to rubble and farmlands scorched beyond recognition. Authorities remain baffled by the cause of these incidents, with theories ranging from freak magical storms to rampaging elementals.\n\n\"It was like nothing I've ever seen,\" said Mira Thornhaven, a merchant who narrowly escaped the destruction of Millbrook, a small farming community near the Droaam border. \"One moment all was calm, the next... it was as if the very earth was screaming.\"\n\nHouse Jorasco healers have been dispatched to affected areas, tending to survivors who speak of an overwhelming sense of rage and despair in the wake of the destruction. King Boranel's court has yet to make an official statement on these events.\n\n  \n\nUNDERWORLD UNREST: GANG VIOLENCE SURGES IN LOWER WARDS\n\nTensions continue to rise in Sharn's lower wards as an ongoing turf war between rival gangs escalates. The City Watch reports an uptick in violence, particularly in the Callestan district.\n\nSources close to the investigation suggest that the conflict centers around control of the lucrative dreamlily trade, with the Boromar Clan and Daask at the heart of the struggle. Residents report frequent skirmishes and suspicious disappearances, while local businesses suffer from increased \"protection\" fees. The situation has prompted calls for increased City Watch presence, but critics argue this may only inflame tensions further. Commander Iyanna ir'Talan of the Daggerwatch Garrison assures citizens that \"all necessary measures\" are being taken to restore order, but declined to provide specifics, citing ongoing operations.\n\nGiant Runes and New Routes\n\nMorgrave University has announced a breakthrough in the study of Xen'drik artifacts, with Professor Gellen ir'Korran claiming to have deciphered previously unknown Giant runes. This development promises to shed new light on pre-Galifar history.\n\nHouse Orien has unveiled plans for an expanded lightning rail network, promising faster travel times between major cities. Critics argue the project may disrupt local ecosystems, while supporters hail it as a necessary step for continued economic growth.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Lore/Sharn Inquisitor Newspaper/Skyway's Floating Gardens Flourish with Rare Flora.md\nIn a delightful spectacle of nature's resilience, Skyway's floating gardens have become home to a rare species of luminescent flowers, previously thought to be native only to the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. The flowers, known as Starlight Blossoms, have begun to bloom in the high towers of [[Sharn]], casting an enchanting glow over the city's skyline.\n\nThe sudden appearance of these flowers has sparked mild curiosity among the citizens and a few scholarly debates in [[Morgrave University|Morgrave University's]] hallowed halls. Botanists are intrigued by how these flowers, typically found in the mystical groves of the Eldeen Reaches, have adapted to the urban environment of Sharn.\n\nIn the political landscape, this event has been largely met with passive interest. Some members of the [[Aurum]] have taken to decorating their estates with these glowing blossoms, viewing them as a status symbol. Meanwhile, [[House Vadalis]], bearers of the Mark of Handling and known for their expertise in flora and fauna, have expressed a desire to study these flowers further.\n\nWhile the Starlight Blossoms' arrival is a minor event in the grand scheme of Sharn's bustling life, it serves as a gentle reminder of the world's enduring magic and mystery.

It enables the user to tap into a crude, unstable form of the primal forces of magic. But like handling raw elemental forces, the risks far outweigh the fleeting benefits.

It is typically consumed by dropping the liquid onto the tongue, where it absorbs quickly into the bloodstream, causing an immediate and potent effect.\n\nUsers often describe the initial effects as a sensation of warmth spreading throughout the body, a quickening of the senses, and an unexplainable feeling of being deeply connected to the mystical weave of magic that permeates the world. Regular users become addicted, not just to the drug's effects but also to the feeling of power and the illusions of insight into the magical world around them.\n\nHowever, the drug's long-term effects can be devastating.

It can lead to hallucinations, erratic behavior, and in the worst cases, wild magical outbursts.\n\n---\n\nThe following is a table of random magical effects Dragon's Blood might trigger.

Each type corresponds to one of the Progenitor Dragons and possesses distinct properties that make them invaluable for different magical applications.\r\n\r\n## Eberron Dragonshards\r\n\r\nEberron dragonshards, colloquially known as \"dragon's blood,\" are the most common variety found throughout Khorvaire. These translucent crystals contain distinctive veins of crimson that pulse with internal radiance when properly activated. They typically form in shallow soil, riverbeds, and similar terrestrial locations.\r\n\r\nTheir primary application lies in elemental binding—the process that powers our lightning rails, airships, and elemental galleons. The unique resonance pattern of these shards allows them to form a containment matrix suitable for housing bound elementals without disrupting their essential nature.\r\n\r\n## Siberys Dragonshards\r\n\r\nThe rarest and most coveted variety, Siberys shards or \"dragon's tears,\" fall from the Ring of Siberys that encircles our world. These golden crystals possess an internal luminescence that appears almost solar in quality. Unlike their earthbound cousins, they must be gathered where they fall, as they cannot be mined or cultivated.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between Siberys shards and dragonmarks cannot be overstated. These fragments enhance dragonmark powers and serve as the foundation for focus items used by marked houses. Their rarity and potency make them especially valuable to the dragonmarked houses, who will pay extraordinary sums for particularly pure specimens.\r\n\r\n## Khyber Dragonshards\r\n\r\nOften referred to as \"dragon's teeth,\" Khyber shards form deep within the world in caverns, fissures, and the darker recesses of Khyber itself. These obsidian-like crystals contain swirling patterns that appear almost like trapped smoke, typically in shades of deep purple or midnight blue.\r\n\r\nThese shards possess a natural affinity for binding extraplanar entities and manipulating the boundaries between planes. For those who wish to pay a heftier price, they may also be used to bind elementals that can power vehicles, similar to Eberron shards. Demonologists and summoners prize them for creating binding circles and receptacles for captured fiends. They also serve as essential components in the creation of certain cursed items and artifacts associated with the darker aspects of magic. Their unpredictable magical properties make them particularly valuable for experimental artifice, though their use is often viewed with suspicion by mainstream magical institutions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Note: This document is approved for circulation among members of the Arcane Congress and licensed researchers only. The detailed applications of Khyber shards in particular should not be distributed to the general public._\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Items/Brains to Woe.md\n\n**The note is smudged and hastily written, with crude scratches as if written in frustration.**\n\n*Woe,\nLast ones no good.

All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.\n - All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead soldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.\n - In a battle during the last war, he sacrificed his and his men's lives in an explosion he set off to overtake the enemy. \n - Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and infused into a warforged body. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.\n - Near the end of the war, he broke free and, using his skills from his past life, destroyed his creation forge.\n\t- He obtained information on his creation, including the methods that were still being used to create new warforged.\n\t- He threatened to go public with that [[forge knowledge handout|info]]. \n\t- Knowing he would be unable to destroy all of the forges on his own, he forced House Cannith's hand into signing the Treaty of Thronehold and shutting down all creation forges, ending the production of new Warforged.\n\t- He didn't go public because in the back of his mind he knew one day he may want to \"have children\" or create new warforged in his name.\n- When he was a human, Forge was blessed with a Mark of Making. As a warforged, his soul carried the mark to his new warforged body, which is now displayed as originating from his chest and creeping out to the rest of his body similarly to a system of veins and arteries that carry an ambient subtle glow who's color reflects his current mood.\n- He is still being chased by agents of House Cannith to recover his blackmail and continue to study him.\n- He has a note ripped out of an artificer's journal he found prior to destroying his creation forge.\n- He was at The Lighthouse because he knew it contained a portal to Sharn.\n\n**Doesn't know**\nWhy he was different and didn't lose his mind\nAnything about geralts parents\nHow the steelhardt works\n### Artificer Journal Page Handout\n\n---\nThe latest series of experiments aimed at recreating The Prototype has once again ended in failure. The primary challenge continues to be the integration of both Khyber and Siberys dragonshards into a single cohesive device.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Energetic Incompatibility:** When attempting to merge Khyber and Siberys dragonshards, the inherent properties of each shard result in violent energetic reactions. The Khyber shard's chaotic dark energy and the Siberys shard's radiant light energy create a destabilizing feedback loop, leading to catastrophic device failure.\n\n3. **Material Fracture:** Even with the most refined binding agents and stabilization matrices, the structural integrity of the device cannot withstand the opposing forces of the shards. Repeated trials show that the casing fractures under the pressure, often shattering both the dragonshards and the housing materials.\n\n3. **Arcane Conductivity Issues:** The arcane circuits designed to channel the combined energies of both shards are proving inadequate. The conduits either overload or burn out, unable to handle the simultaneous flow of both types of energy. This results in significant power loss and unpredictable surges.\n\n**Current Adjustments & Theories:**\n- **Single Shard Usage:** Given the repeated failures with dual-shard integration, we have temporarily shifted our focus to single shard implementations. Utilizing only a Khyber or Siberys shard simplifies the energy matrix, but this solution is incomplete and leads to noted psychosis in test subjects. The posthumous cooperation of fallen soldiers provides critical insights, yet their spirits are less stable under these conditions. Stabilization methods are in testing phase and are proving effective. \n\n- **Arcane Filtration:** We are exploring the potential of using arcane filters or buffers to mediate the energies of the two shards. The idea is to create a phased energy conduit that can sequentially manage the influx and outflux of each shard's energy rather than attempting simultaneous integration.\n---\n\n**End of Entry**\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Items/Horn of the Godcaller.md\n1/day - Use an action, until the start of your next turn any allies within 30ft of you have advantage on their attacks.

It has a rapid, darting glow, as though something is bouncing off the inner walls of the shard, trying to find an exit.\n- This dragonshard has been implanted with a part of Geralt's mother's consciousness, locked behind the memories she placed within. \n- Yelena and Norbit created this object in secret after seeing Merix d'Cannith's intentions with the [[Plot Web#Steelhardt (The Prototype)|Steelhardt]]. The Legacy Stone was intended as a way to communicate with [[Plot Web#PC Geralt Wolfsbane|Geralt]] about the dangers of their work should they die.\n- Once all of the memories have been experienced by Geralt, part of Yelena's consciousness will be accessible, and she will be able to speak to Geralt through his mind. **She will only have the memories of her life up until she created the Legacy Stone.**\n\n### Interacting With It:\n\n- Once per long rest, when Geralt concentrates for at least 10 minutes while holding the Legacy Stone, he experiences a surge of warmth before his mind is flooded with a memory that is chosen at random from the table below.\n- Geralt will continue to become 'ill' after every memory experienced due to his mother's consciousness trying to manifest within Geralt's mind. After the last memory, Geralt will become seriously ill. **He will have 1d4 days to heal until he is completely taken over by his mother.**\n- If he is healed by *Greater Restoration*, his mother's consciousness will be wiped from his mind.\n\n***First Interaction***\n>The Siberys dragonshard pulses warmly in your hand, its golden light seeping into your skin. For a moment, the *surroundings* around you fades, replaced by a rush of sensations, emotions, and fragmented images. It’s not your memory, you realize, but hers. You are seeing the world through your mother's eyes, feeling the world through her body.\n\n| #   | Memory               | Viewed? |\n| --- | -------------------- | ------- |\n| 1   | Kismet's Prophecy    | y       |\n| 2   | Norbit's Illness     | y       |\n| 3   | Sibernyan Discovery  | y       |\n| 4   | Steelhardt Prototype | y       |\n| 5   | House Cannith Escape | y       |\n| 6   | The Rageblight       | y       |\n\n***Memory Descriptions***\n**Kismet's Prophecy:** \n> The world shimmers, your senses flooded with the sights and smells of a crowded marketplace. You feel a small hand clutching yours as you and Norbit stand before a half-elf woman with striking eyes. She traces lines on your palm, her touch strangely warm. An unsettling feeling of knowing, of seeing threads of destiny intertwining, washes over you. She doesn't speak, but images flash through your mind – a towering city, a shattered land, a powerful artifact, a snowy peak, a young boy facing a daunting task. A cold dread grips your heart.\n\n**Norbit's Illness:**\n> The air is heavy with the scent of parchment and ink. Lamplight flickers across a cluttered desk, illuminating diagrams and notes. You feel Norbit's hand trembling in yours as he coughs, a rattling sound that echoes in the silence. A wave of nausea washes over you, not from the illness, but from the crushing realization that time is slipping away. You glance at a drawing of a complex device, its intricate workings promising a solution, a chance to cheat fate.\n\n**Sibernyan Discovery:**\n>Wind howls outside, rattling the shutters of a small, isolated cabin perched atop a snow-covered mountain. Inside, a fire crackles in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on rough-hewn walls. You feel a mixture of anticipation and unease as you sit across a table from a figure shrouded in a thick cloak, his face obscured by the shadows. As he speaks, his voice is a low, melodic rumble, unlike any language you've ever heard. You sense an ancient wisdom, a connection to something beyond mortal comprehension. Norbit leans forward, his brow furrowed in concentration as he grasps the strange words, responding in kind.\n\n**Steelhardt Prototype:** \n>The air vibrates with energy, tingling your skin. A faint humming sound fills the chamber as you and Norbit stand before a pulsing device. You feel a surge of triumph as you complete the final connection, the culmination of years of research. A brilliant light flares, momentarily blinding you, then fades, leaving behind a sense of awe and a lingering taste of ozone. A deep, primal fear whispers within you, a warning about the choices you've made, about the forces you've put into motion. You've done what no one else could, you've conquered a primal force of nature with nothing but your minds. You should be relieved. And yet, you can't shake the feeling that you just changed the course of the world in more ways than you can imagine. \n\n**House Cannith Escape:**\n>Rain lashes your face, cold and relentless. Your heart pounds in your chest as you and Norbit race through the dark, winding alleys, a crying young boy clutched in your arms. You feel the presence of pursuers, their footsteps echoing on the cobblestones. You turn a corner, praying you lost them. Norbit squeezes your shoulder as you calm the boy whose head is nuzzling into your shirt. Terror grips you, fueled by the knowledge that you're not just protecting yourselves, but something far more precious, something that could change the world.\n\n**The Rageblight**\n> Three inch thick glass encased by cold steel is all that separates yourself and Norbit from... him. He's strapped to an exam table by concrete reinforced bindings that stress and crack as he strains against them. Dark red veins spider-web across his skin, which looks as though its been stretched across his body, as though any more tension would cause it to rip and tear in places. A large scar runs down the middle of his chest, inflamed and irritated. His eyes are jet black. \"I don't know why this happened,\" you say aloud, \"Our math checked out. The components were good. There's got to be something we're missing.\" Norbit starts a reply, but its interrupted with a cough from his lungs and a splatter of blood in his palm. Marix talks over him, his eyes fixed on the creature in the other room, \"This is what happens if we get this wrong. He was one of my best before he volunteered. Now... I don't think there's anything left of him inside.\" The thing on the other side of the glass began to scream and strain against his bindings. The one holding his left arm splinters and shatters.

I despise dealing with coin-clutchers and contract-lickers, but I had no other choice. The winds that once whispered omens to me now howl with silence, and I find myself looking into shadows where once there was light.\n\nHrothgar grows stronger. The dark plight upon his soul has become a weight upon our people, pressing them into submission, into something lesser than what they once were. There was a time when our kin followed you out of loyalty, believing in your strength. Now, they've been corrupted, made to kneel under his influence.\n\nI have tried to see what is to come, to divine the path ahead. But Hrothgar is a void in my sight. He always was, even when he was a boy, his future was never clear to me. I remember one vision, long ago—one that still lingers in my mind like the scent of blood in the snow. I saw him, standing over a cliff side, a divine weapon resting at his feet, a small purple crystal dangling from a necklace in the palm of his hand. The body of a man clad in bloody steel tumbled to the rocks below. That was the farthest I ever glimpsed into his fate. Beyond that, there was nothing. I did not understand the meaning of it then, and now, as I watch the man he has become, I wonder if that moment was always meant to be a turning point.\n\nA year and a half ago, a man came to our camp. He did not leave. Though it pains me to write this, I wonder if it should have been Hrothgar thrown fruom that cliff instead.\n\nI fear what is coming, my dear Bearwolf. Not because I know what is ahead, but because for the first time in my life, I do not. Even when I foresaw Kvitrafn’s death, there was sorrow, but there was also a certainty in it. I could prepare. I could grieve before the loss came. But now, I stand in the dark, blind to what lies ahead. And that terrifies me.\n\nDo not mistake my words for a plea, my son. You are your own man, walking your own path. But if the winds carry you back to these lands, know that the world you left behind is not the one you will find.\n\nYour Mother\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Items/Scepter of Madness.md\nUsed by Inquisitor Thale while with the CotSF purification squads.

He is also Miri's mentor. He has always been a curious and inquisitive mind. He noticed the modern warforged are an exponential improvement on the original, in addition to their newfound sentience. Since then, he's been obsessed with a single burning question: What changed?\n\n### Description\n\n- Demographics:\n\t- 38 year old half-elf male\n\t- Born to an Elven mother and Human father\n\t- Born as Aeren Thorne on 8 Therendor, 960YK\n\t- Born and raised in Fairhaven, Aundair\n\n- Appearance: Aeren is considered young for a half-elf with short ruffled hair, bright green eyes, and a perpetual half-smile.

He is able to take simple commands, however he is not sentient.\n\n### Backstory\n\nA proficient and acclaimed artificer of House Cannith (invented the Everbright lantern), Aeren holds the title of the youngest Master Artificer [[House Cannith]] has ever known. Having been born outside of the Dragonmarked house to an Elven mother and human father, Aeren is also the only Master Artificer that does not bare a *Mark of Making.\n\nAfter becoming a Master Artificer, he was gifted an old and almost forgotten workshop to use as his own. He was always obsessed with the great warforged creations, though his probing questions were always met with standard answers. The mystery only served to intrigue Aeren more.\n\nAfter some investigation, Aeren dug up old documents that listed required strange components for a new theoretical creation. The document was signed by Yelena and Norbit Wolfsbane.\n\n### Group Patron\nCompensation\n- 10gp x party level x days worked on mission\n\nBenefits\n- 10% discount on services\n- House agent independence\n- Free board at Aeren's workshop\n### Motivations\n\n- Alignment: Chaotic Good\n- Short term goals: Hire the party to search Geralt's parents old workshop.\n- Long term aspirations: Understand the secrets of what gifted the modern warforged sentience.\n\n### Allies & Enemies\n\n- Faction: Associated with House Cannith \n- Allies: Other investigators and info brokers\n- Enemies: Rivals dealing in secret information\n\n### Roleplaying Tips\n\nPlay up his charm, wit, and curiosity.

Prices for these services would be influenced by factors like the complexity of information requested, potential risks involved in acquiring it, and any necessary travel expenses.\n\nSpecialized combat operations offered by House Deneith are tailored to suit specific client needs such as covert missions or large-scale battles. Prices for these operations would depend on factors like mission objectives, required resources (including personnel and equipment), and the level of risk involved.\n\nIt is important to note that House Deneith does not publicly disclose specific pricing information for their services.

They are known as the House of Hospitality, and their primary focus is on providing food, drink, and lodging to travelers across the continent of [[Khorvaire]]. \n\nConnections: House Ghallanda maintains strong connections with other noble houses such as [[House Jorasco]] (healers), [[House Orien]] (messengers and transportation), and [[House Phiarlan]] (entertainers). These alliances help them provide comprehensive services to their customers.\n\n---\n\nPopular Establishments: House Ghallanda owns and operates numerous establishments throughout Khorvaire. Some more well known inns - like the [[Gold Dragon Inn]] - are directly owned and operated chains. Others are smaller independent inns. Rest assure that if it bears the Blink Dog logo, it meets the House Ghallanda standard.\n\nSome well-known establishments include:\n\n1. The Gold Dragon Inn: Located in every major city across Khorvaire, this inn offers luxurious accommodations and exquisite dining options to both locals and visitors. This is the flagship Inn of House Ghallanda, with each run by veteran Ghallanda halflings.\n\n2. The Gilded Grain Brewery: Situated in the city of [[Wroat]], this brewery produces some of the finest ales and beers in all of Khorvaire.\n\n3.

House Jorasco has been providing its services to the people of Khorvaire for centuries.\n\nThought House Jorasco will provide healing services to all who need it (and all who can afford it), there are rumors that House Jorasco worked with [[House Vadalis]] during the [[Last War]], potentially developing biological weapons.\n\n---\n\nServices Rendered:\n1. Healing: House Jorasco offers various healing services to individuals who require immediate medical attention or long-term care. They have highly skilled healers proficient in both magical and non-magical methods of treatment.\n\n2. Restoration: In addition to physical healing, House Jorasco also specializes in restoration services that focus on mental well-being. They provide counseling, therapy, and even magical treatments to help individuals recover from trauma or overcome mental health issues.\n\n3. Disease Control: House Jorasco has dedicated teams working on disease control and prevention. They conduct research, develop vaccines, and offer consultations on how to maintain good health and prevent the spread of illnesses.\n\n4. Training Programs: As part of their commitment to spreading knowledge and improving healthcare standards across Khorvaire, House Jorasco offers training programs for aspiring healers. These programs cover various aspects of medicine, from basic first aid to advanced magical healing techniques.\n\n---\n\nPrices:\nThe cost of services provided by House Jorasco varies depending on the severity of the condition, duration of treatment required, and ability to pay. However, Ulara d'Jorasco's vision is to ensure that healing and restoration services are accessible to all, regardless of their financial standing. As a result, House Jorasco operates on a sliding scale, offering discounted or even free services to those in need.\n\nWhile the exact prices for specific treatments may vary, House Jorasco always strives to find a balance between sustaining their operations and fulfilling their mission of providing healing and restoration to all who seek it.\n\n---\n\n### Diamond Conspiracy\nImmortality is bad for business. House Jorasco thrives on being the premier source of healing and ressurection, the latter part of which generates them a significant amount of money. Cheap ressurection isn't easy to come by - and House Jorasco leaders make sure it stays that way.\n\nThe lowest and most available form of true ressurection is _Revivify_. With access to a large diamond, any common cleric could perform ressurection services, potentially sucking away profits and renown from Jorasco clerics.\n\nDid you know diamonds really aren't that hard to find? In fact, Eberron has a wealth of diamonds in it's cave systems. However, shady contracts, lobbying, and intimidation with governments and land owners has allowed House Jorasco to establish a near monopoly on diamond mining, allowing them to exponentially inflate their price.\n\nThis is a secret kept close to the House's chest, and they don't take kindly to purchased from unsanctioned dealers, nor do they enjoy lowly adventurers asking questions.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Factions/Dragonmarked Houses/House Vadalis.md\nLeader: [[Dalin d'Vadalis]]\nEmblem: Hippogriff\nHQ: Foalswood, [[Eldeen Reaches]]\nRace: Human\n\nHouse Vadalis is one of the twelve dragonmarked houses.

The shopping list he found probably has something to do with that\n- He concluded that the mechanism has to have something to do with transferring the souls of soldiers into the warforged, especially with them studying a lich phylactery to create it.\n- He recognizes the script from an old nursery rhyme his mother used to read to him. He finds the old book, titled \"*When the Couatl sing*\" and realized it was a draconic script that used to be used by the most devout followers of Siberys, the Dragon Above.\n- He went to the library to do research on the language. Unable to find anything on the language, he asked the librarian for their books on religious history. He checked out a book titled \"*Godlings, Demigods, and other Mythical Creatures*\" and left.\n- On his way back, he ran into Boromar Clan thugs, who kidnapped him at the order of Halak Boromar. (He is wanted for his technological ability and knowledge of the arcane. They want to use him to work with the professor and figure out the use/purpose of the FKD fragment they got from the professor.)\n- When he is kidnapped, he dropped his book on the ground, which can be found by the party.\n- The gang members can also be encountered and looted, and [[Aeren's Written Notes]] may be looted.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Brainstorms/Dreamlily Den.md\nReference\n- [[#Plot|Plot]]\n\t- [[#Plot#Description|Description]]\n\t- [[#Plot#Clues|Clues]]\n- [[#Roster|Roster]]\n- [[#Dreamlily Dust|Dreamlily Dust]]\n\t- [[#Dreamlily Dust#Unrefined|Unrefined]]\n\t- [[#Dreamlily Dust#Refined|Refined]]\n- [[#Loot|Loot]]\n\n---\n\nWarehouse full of poor workers creating Dreamlily for the Boromar clan\n- Run by Halak Boromar's side, not Castar\n- Enforcers all left moments before party arrived, after they were informed of an incoming raid by the Red Cloak Battalion\n\n## Plot\n\n### Description\n- Front door appears shut from a distance > was left slightly ajar\n - Turned over furniture, scattered alchemical equipment, general signs of leaving in a hurry.\n - Bloody dead bodies > corpses are dressed in dirty clothes wearing cloth mouth coverings > hands covered with Dreamlily dust.\n - Office room in back > nice wood chair & desk > see clues\n### Clues\n\n**Office**\n- Desk > Note, book, cup of warm tea\n\t- **Note.** *\"We have a mole.

This will summon and bind Vorak to their location.\n\n**Legacy Stone Stats:** AC 18, 50 HP, resistant to all damage except necrotic\n\nThis leads to a primary objective during the fight other than simply beating Vorak into submission. The legacy stone causes Vorak to...\n1. fight in different stages that must be defeated differently?\n2. Release collections of power that must be destroyed to weaken Vorak?\n3. Some other boss fight mechanic?\n\nAfter this is achieved, Vorak will be left unable to fight back, his mind cleaned of its dark blight, however his life soon to be over.\n\n### Phase 1: The Binding (HP 100% to 70%)\n\n**Key Mechanic**: Vorak is tethered to the Legacy Stone with energy threads. He can not leave the rageblight zone.\n\n- During this phase, Vorak will try to break free of the binding.\n- Players must protect the Legacy Stone while fighting Vorak.\n\n**Environmental effect:** \n- Pockets of concentrated rage appear as swirling red mist that damage players:\n\t- 3d6 psychic damage\n\t- 10ft radius\n\t- 1 will spawn within 15 feet of each PC. At the start of each round, a pocket will move to the location that it's PC was in at the start of their last turn.\n\n**Special Actions**:\n\n- **Barbarous Leap:** Vorak can use his bonus action to jump a distance equal to his speed in the direction of his target, without imposing opportunity attacks.\n- **Rage Siphon**: Vorak absorbs nearby rage pockets, healing himself for 2d10 HP per pocket.\n- **Unleash Fury**: AOE attack dealing damage to all creatures within 10 feet, or half on dex save, knocking them back 10 ft and prone upon a fail.\n\n**Transition**: \n- When Vorak reaches 70% HP, he lets out a horrific scream and shatters the ground around him. All creatures within 30 ft are shoved 30 feet back and fall prone on a high dex save throw.\n- The shockwave also disperses all rage pockets.\n\n### Phase 2: Fractured Sigils (70% - 40%)\n**Key Mechanic:**\n- The tethering lines morph and shift, turning into radiantly glowing sigils that float in fixed positions on the battlefield. Destroying one sigil removed 5% of Vorak's HP. Vorak is immune to direct damage while at least 1 sigil remains. He has advantage to all saving throws while at least 3 sigils remains.\n\n**Environmental effect:**\n- **Shattered Identity**: Vorak creates 1d4 clones of himself out of the rage mists with 5 HP each, which Dash towards Vorak on their turn. If not destroyed quickly, they merge back with him and heal him xd10 hp each.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Brainstorms/Legacy stone cures hrothgar.md\n\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Narrative Plot Overview.md\nIn the land of Eberron, the balance of power teeters on the brink of chaos. The Silver Flame, a mystical force that has safeguarded the realm for centuries, is missing and slowly burning out. This disappearance, coupled with the threat of the Lords of Dust attempting to free the Overlord Rak Tulkesh, casts a shadow of impending doom across the world. Amidst this turmoil, a group of unlikely heroes emerges, their destinies intertwined by fate and their shared quest to protect their world.\n\n### The Heroes\n\n**Bjorn \"Bearwolf\" Ulfr**, a proud warrior from the Stormpeak Clan, finds his life shattered when his brother Hrothgar, tainted by a dark dragonshard, usurps his rule. Hrothgar’s corruption plunges their homeland into darkness, forcing Bjorn to gather a new group of allies, united by shared ideals and a common enemy.\n\n**Draven Flameforge**, once known as the Knight of the North, is a legend reborn. Hailing from the Flameforge Clan in the Byeshk Mountains, Draven was trained by Varyn the Valiant, the last of the Couatls. Varyn, burdened by regret and self-doubt, sacrificed much of his remaining power to resurrect Draven after he was killed by Hrothgar. Now, Draven, devoid of his past memories, carries the weight of Varyn’s hopes and the light of Siberys, seeking to hold back the forces of Khyber.\n\n**Geralt Wolfsbane** lives on the edge of civilization near the Whitehorn Woods, haunted by the loss of his parents, who were once brilliant artificers of House Cannith. They fled the House to protect their revolutionary design, the Steelhardt, from being misused. Geralt, driven by a mysterious page covered in ancient Sibernyan runes, seeks to unlock its secrets and uncover the truth about his parents’ work.\n\n**Forge**, the first successful soul-transferred Warforged, is an enigma. Created using the souls of fallen soldiers and an unprecedented balance of Siberys and Khyber aspects, Forge retained his memories and sanity. After escaping House Cannith’s control, he destroyed his creation forge and now carries vital knowledge about the Warforged’s true nature. Hunted by his creators, Forge grapples with the ethical implications of his existence and the potential to create more like himself.\n\n### The Villains\n\n**Vorak**, once a loyal assassin of House Cannith, underwent a dark transformation through the Steelhardt. His failed transfer left him a creature of pure rage, manipulated by Mordakhesh, a lieutenant of Rak Tulkesh. Now, Vorak roams the land, his existence tied to the suffering and rage of those he destroys, perpetuating a cycle of death and resurrection.\n\n**Woe**, a soldier from the Last War, was resurrected by Mordakhesh using a fragment of the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard. Now a Warforged infused with dark power, Woe seeks to reunite the shards, believing it will liberate his new race and exact revenge on those who wronged him.\n\n**Mordakhesh** himself is the architect behind many of the heroes’ woes. As a loyal servant of Rak Tulkesh, he guides Woe and others in a relentless quest to free his master. His manipulations are subtle, his motives shrouded in secrecy, making him a dangerous adversary.\n\n**Hrothgar**, Bjorn’s corrupted brother, wields dark power that plagues the land. His possession of a dragonshard fragment and the Etherseraph, a powerful artifact, has turned him into a formidable foe, threatening the very fabric of their homeland.\n\n### Artifacts of Power\n\nThe **Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD)** contains the essence of Rak Tulkesh. Scattered in fragments, it grants immense power to those tainted by its dark influence. Woe, Professor Baelen ir'Torn, and Hrothgar each hold fragments, their fates intertwined by the shard’s corrupting touch.\n\nThe **Etherseraph**, crafted by Varyn, is both a weapon and a guide. Its white flame has the power to clear the Mourning’s fog and reveal the path to the Silver Flame’s hidden sanctuary. Once wielded by heroes like Tira Miron and Draven, it now lies in the hands of Hrothgar.\n\nThe **Steelhardt**, originally designed by Geralt’s parents, can transfer a soul into a new body, promising immortality. However, without the balance of Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron’s aspects, its use results in madness. The Lords of Dust seek to use it to free Rak Tulkesh, making it a central piece in the unfolding drama.\n\n### Factions and Intrigue\n\n**House Cannith**, led by Marix d'Cannith, is steeped in secrets and dark experiments. Their involvement in the creation of Warforged and the Day of Mourning positions them as a pivotal player in the world’s fate.\n\nThe **Church of the Silver Flame**, desperate to locate the missing Silver Flame, collaborates with Baelen ir'Torn to harness the power of the dragonshard fragments. Unaware of the Flame’s true location, their quest is fraught with peril and deception.\n\nThe **Boromar Clan**, driven by greed and the promise of power, pursues the dragonshard fragments with relentless ambition. Their actions add another layer of complexity to the already tangled web of intrigue.\n\n### Themes and Questions\n\nAs the heroes navigate their quests, they grapple with profound questions about morality, redemption, and the nature of evil. Can those born into darkness find their way to the light? What does it take to redeem oneself after a great failure? Through their struggles, they uncover that most villains are not purely evil but shaped by their justifications and past traumas.\n\nThe world of Eberron stands on the edge of a knife. The heroes must forge their paths, facing inner demons and external threats, to protect what remains of the Silver Flame and prevent the release of an ancient evil. Their intertwined destinies and the choices they make will determine the fate of their world.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/All Arcs.md\n## Arc Setup\nStory arcs are set up in a very specific way that is shown below. The idea is that at least one of these arcs is being moved forward every session. This is combined with a more extensive plot web to create a  cohesive and intuitive narrative experience for the players.\n\nIf a list under an Arc is numbered, this represents the order of priority, not necessarily the order it will be completed. The plot points towards the top of each list are more significant, while the ones towards the bottom may be less significant to the main plot, and more prone to being changed or discarded.\n\nEach arc has a \"completion point\" which indicates when that arc will be wrapped up and the next one will begin.\n\nArcs do not have to be completed in any particular order, and many immediate arcs may be completed before a narrative arc is completed (or even before it becomes the main focus).\n\n##### Immediate Arc\n- This is what the players are attempting to accomplish at this moment or in the immediate future.\n- Each is generally wrapped up within a few sessions\n- Generally can be extrapolated from sub-plots of narrative arcs\n- Thought of in terms of short-term, obvious, and achievable goals, like episodes of a TV show\n\t- Ex.: *Obtain horses to improve travel on the long roads ahead*\n\t- Ex. 2: *Assist an apothecary that you encountered on your journey*\n\n##### Narrative Arc\n- This is what the collective immediate arcs are building towards\n- Each is generally wrapped up with their own satisfying and self-contained storylines\n- Thought of in terms of seasons of a TV show. Goals are more long-term and may not be immediately obvious to PCs\n\t- Ex.: *Safely travel around the nation and make it to the City of Towers*\n\t- Ex. 2: *Figure out why tensions are high in Sharn and fix it.*\n\n##### Personal Arc\n* This is what each individual player's story arc looks like.\n* Different parts of the campaign will have a greater focus on different players.\n* Some player's arcs may be of a similar focus.\n* Multiple player's personal arcs can be of equal focus at any one time.\n* Think of these as \"character development\".\n* Parts of the personal arc:\n\t* *Actualization.* The ultimate end-stage of this character's development. The biggest over-arching goal of this character. When realized, this character arc is considered 'finished'.\n\t* *Prerequisites.* These are certain story beats that must be hit in one way or another in order for the actualization to take place or make sense in the context of the story.\n\n##### Campaign Arc\n- The overall theme or main arc of the entire campaign\n- Built up to by each narrative arc, becoming more obvious as the game goes on\n- Completion of this arc marks the end of the campaign\n- Should provide a satisfying ending that involves the culmination of everything the PCs have accomplished so far\n\t- Ex.: *The final fight with the ultimate BBEG*\n\n\n\n\n## Arcs\n\n### Immediate\n- Escape the crashing Boromar HQ\n- Establish a plan to leave the city\n\n### Narrative\n\n#### Act 1: The Journey\n- *Overview:* The party's

fragment\n\t- Left shortly after once he realized what he had caused\n- Hrothgar Ulfr (Bjorn's brother)\n\t- Was born when a piece of the fractured shard was nearby, tainting his soul\n\t- Slowly gained unnatural (sorcerer-like) powers that use his evil and rage as fuel, increasing the dark cancers hold on him\n\t- Fueled by these emotions and the dark taint on his soul, he led a group of clan members and usurped his brother's rule.\n\t- He eventually killed Draven Flameforge, who came for him to cleanse the land, and the dragonshard fragment he obtained continued fueling his rage and increasing his power.\n\t- His power now noticeably plagues the land.\n- Old Clan members\n\t- Some were enthralled by Hrothgar\n\t- Most others remain loyal to Bjorn\n\t- Ones that didn't leave are forced to hide their disagreement d/t Hrothgar's increasing power.\n- Bjorn's new group\n\t- Whos it composed of?\n\t- Why do they hate Hrothgar\n\t- They don't, Bjorn joined them together via shared ideals\n\t- Some members are former Stormpeak members\n\t- left after Hrothgar takeover\n\n#### PC: Draven Flameforge\n- Byeshk Mountains\n\t- Neighboring Stormpeak Clan\n\t- May have crossed paths after Bjorn was usurped\n- Clan Flameforge\n\t- Founded by Varyn to keep overwatch on the Overlords and oppose the LoD.\n- He worships Siberys along with the clan \n\t- Couatl are a creation of Siberys, along with dragons\n- Trained by Varyn to be a great warrior, Draven took an oath to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber, and to protect the Khyber Dragonshard fragment gifted to him by Varyn.\n- He traveled Khorvaire and fought creatures of Khyber when they popped up.\n- He became a legend, known as the Knight of the North.\n- He eventually found his way to the Stormpeak clan, after Hrothgar had usurped Bjorn.\n\t- Draven could sense the dark cancer on his soul, and tried to vanquish him.\n\t- During their battle, Hrothgar took the dragonshard fragment and used the power it gave him to kill Draven and take the ***Etherseraph***, solidifying the hold Hrothgar had over the Stormpeak Clan.\n\t- Draven's body fell off a cliffside, landing in the snow hundreds of feet below.\n- Varyn found Draven's corpse.\n\t- Varyn used most of his remaining power to heal Draven, but didn't have enough left to return his memories.\n\t- Varyn is now old, weak, and near powerless, filled with a great shame for his many failures in life.\n\n#### PC: Geralt Wolfsbane\n- Yelena & Norbit Wolfsbane\n\t- Geralt's mother and father\n\t- Wolfsbane is Norbit's family name\n\t- They both adopted the d'Cannith name, then later gave it up after they left the house.\n- Parents died when he was young\n\t- Killed by Vorak (prior to transformation) as ordered by Marix d'Cannith.\n- Geralt's parents originally created the first designs of the Steelhardt while they were a part of House Cannith\n\t- It was originally intended to be a way of transferring one's \"soul\" to a new body, effectively producing immortality.\n\t\t- The consciousness was attached to the Steelhardt in a magical ritual\n\t\t- It then had to be implanted into a corpse for the consciousness to then take over.\n\t\t- They created one prototype, combining a Khyber & Siberys shard in the device\n\t\t- It was fully functional as intended, but they never wrote down how they got those two shards to work together.\n\t\t- Cannith Artificer's subsequent attempts to combine the shards in new designs always failed.\n\t- They worked for years refining the designs.\n\t- Marix, working with the LoD, took an interest in these designs for use in creating a sentient warforged army.\n\t\t- Yelena and Norbit found out about Marix's plans and fled House Cannith with all of the designs, hiding with their young son near the Whitehorn Woods.\n- Geralt was snooping in his father's office when he found the designs laid out across his desk.\n\t\t- Being unable to read them, he stole a page that had 'cool' designs and runes on it, also bearing the Gorgon seal of House Cannith.\n\t\t- He still has this page to this day.\n\t\t- A part of why he has learnt so many languages was to decode this page, but he was never able to.\n\t\t\t- It is written in an ancient language that his parents spoke, due to their inherent secrecy (**Sibernyan**)\n\t\t\t- Language was prominently spoken by the Couatl.\n- One night his parents were murdered in their home by Vorak, who stole the prototype schematics. \n- When his parents were killed, he escaped and fled into the woods. He was about 12. He learned to live off the land and was able to survive.\n- He now lives near Shavalant and the Whitehorn Woods.\n\n#### PC: Forge\n- Forge was created in the first batch of modern warforged - and the only one that didn't lose his mind due to his new found form. All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.\n\t- The missing traits being: The soul being transferred MUST have aspects of Khyber & aspects of Siberys fused to the soul to transfer without sanity loss.\n\t- Forge's Steelhardt used Siberys shards as a conduit. In all other warforged in his batch, only having a Siberys shard wasn't enough, since there was no aspect of Khyber attached to their soul/in the Steelhardt.\n\t- Hence why Vorak's transfer was tainted as well. His Steelhardt used a Khyber shard conduit, but there was no aspect of Siberys attached to him.\n\t- Since Forge died in proximity to Lick's father's FKD fragment, an aspect of Khyber attached to his soul, which, in addition to the Siberys Dragonshard conduit in his Steelhardt, meant he retained his memories AND his sanity.\n\t- This information about the missing traits is not currently known **(Vorak stole most of the schematics, however Geralt's schematic is the only one that mentions this requirement.)\n- All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead soldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.\n- Forge was a human general of **House Cannith**\n- In a battle during the last war, he sacrificed his and his men's lives in an explosion he set off to overtake the enemy.\n\t- Lick's father and Woe were in Forge's squad. Forge valued winning the battle/war over the lives of his own men. While Woe and Lick's father were engaged in battle, Forge made the decision to sacrifice himself and his entire squad to blow up and destroy the enemy and win the battle for his side.\n\t- Woe died close to Lick's father's fragment of the *FKD*, causing an aspect of Khyber to latch onto his soul which allowed him to be resurrected into a Warforged body through Mordakhesh's ritual (more details in Woe's backstory)\n- Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and infused into a warforged body. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.\n- Near the end of the war, he broke free and, using his skills from his past life, **destroyed his creation forge**.\n\t- He obtained information on his creation, including the methods that were still being used to create new warforged.\n\t- **He threatened to go public with that [[forge knowledge handout|info]]? (Knowing he would be unable to destroy all of the forges on his own, he forced House Cannith's hand into signing the Treaty of Thronehold and shutting down all creation forges, ending the production of new Warforged?)(Maybe he didn't go public because in the back of his mind he knew one day he may want to \"have children\"? See 'character motivation'.** \n- Warforged were not liberated due to the Treaty of Thronehold. This treaty was a political move so that Forge would not go public with the information he holds on Warforged production and ruin House Cannith's reputation.\n- Due to the ever-looming threat of blackmail, House Cannith has been hunting Forge ever since his escape, attempting to **capture him for further study (probably to continue to attempt to replicate the traits that allowed him to keep his memories)** and eliminate the possibility of that information ever getting out.\n- He was branded with a unique dragonmark on the front of this chest. It contains the House Cannith Gorgan, in addition to markings that read \"FORGE 2\".\n- He learned of **another creation forge in Sharn (How did he find out?)**, explaining his presence outside the lighthouse during his introduction to the campaign in session 5, because he was looking for the teleportation circle inside The Lighthouse.\n- ***Character motivation:***\n\t- Is it unethical to create more in my image? Does that make me a God, or does that make me one of you (normal people)?\n\n#### PC: Sylas Stormshadow (Deceased)\n- Father was an Elven scholar focused on forbidden knowledge about magic\n- Mother was a human merchant in Sharn's Underbelly\n- Learned of eldritch power through his father\n- Made a pact w/ the Traveler in the sewers\n- Would be randomly taken to a different plane for the Traveler's duties\n\n#### PCs: Lox & Nyx Tempest\n* Lox & Nyx are married. They think that they lost their daughter *Elix* in the airship attack at the hands of *Woe*.\n\t*  Elix was supposed to be traveling on the airship back to Nyx's homeland in the forest to spend time with her druidic side of the family.\n* **Lox**\n\t* Lox made a pact with a demon/devil to give Lox the power to enact revenge against his daughter's killer.\n\t\t* ***Lox Secret:***\n\t\t\t* His pact is with *Mordakesh*. Lox has no idea the significance of his patron, but Mordakesh will ensure Lox plays a vital role in releasing his Overlord.\n\t\t\t* **The Contract.**\n\t\t\t\t* Mordakesh approached Lox, which is very rare in the world of warlock patrons.\n\t\t\t\t\t* This happened before their daughter died, so Mordakesh showed Lox a vision of the future, convincing him that Lox would need this power to protect his family.\n\t\t\t\t* The *draconic prophecy* led Mordakesh to Lox, suggesting that he would play a pivotal role in the final part of the plan to resurrect *Rak Tulkesh*.\n\t\t\t\t* The contract is simple: Mordakesh provides Lox with his powers, and in return Lox will owe a single favor that will be redeemed when Mordakesh seems fit.\n\t\t\t\t\t* Failure to perform the favor will result in Lox losing \"what he values most\".\n* **Nyx**\n\t* Nyx is a druid, raised in the forest by her family.\n\t* Nyx starts 'hallucinating' visions of her daughter, perhaps past memories that play out in front of her.\n\t\t* Ex.: she might see a version of her daughter when she was young, who is picking flowers outside and giggling to herself\n\t* These hallucinations could be used to build Nyx's backstory with *Elix*.\n\t* Who is causing these hallucinations? *Kismet*? Why?\n* ***Characters motivation:***\n\t* After learning of the airship crash and *Elix's* probable death, Lox & Nyx embarked on a quest to find and kill her murderer.\n* ***Secret.***\n\t* *Elix* isn't actually dead, because she was never on *The Merkentile*. \n\t* Through visions and secret communications, Mordakhesh contacted Elix and convinced her to join him.\n\t* He convinced Elix that he is fighting to restore the \"natural order\" to the world, to bring nature back to the forefront.\n\t* Elix does truly believe that technology has ruined people, and that going back to more druidic times would be the greater good.\n\t* She now sits beside Mordakhesh, ignorant to his plans.\n\n## Story Plot Pieces\n- #### **Themes**:\n\t- What makes a person good? \n\t- Most villains aren't purely evil, but have their own justifications.\n\t- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?\n\t- If one has only known evil since birth, are they redeemable or can they overcome that nature? \n\n#### Central Tension\n- The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh\n\t- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. \n\t\t- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed\n\t\t- The silver flame caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so\n\t\t- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world\n\n#### Significant Lore\n- The Origin of the Warforged\n\t- Warforged are the man-made reincarnates of the fallen soldiers in the Last War; Their souls were repurposed as weapons in the war that took their lives once already.\n\t- The first few batches of Warforged were created without a 'soul' - mindless automatons that had no self initiative or instinct. They were grunts, they followed orders, but on average they were less effective than a typical soldier.\n\t- Cannith artificers - at the order of Marix d'Cannith - devised a method of transferring the soul of a recently deceased humanoid into the body of a warforged - building on the original *Steelhardt* designs taken from Geralt's parents.\n\n#### Significant NPCs\n\n##### Varyn \"The Valiant\" Grayburn\n- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.\n- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl\n- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame\n- Takes the form of an old man missing his left arm at the shoulder. His true form has a partially missing left wing.\n- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons\n\t- Directly oppose actions of the Lords of Dust\n\t- A small group within felt that Clan Flameforge's scope was too narrow.\n\t- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.\n- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.\n\t- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.\n\t- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.\n\t- The LoD found out and also began a search.\n\t- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.\n\t- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.\n- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.\n- He saw the purity and potential within Draven\n\t- The darkness within the shard never affected him.\n- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:\n\t- The *Etherseraph*\n\t- An *FKD* fragment\n- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber\n\n##### Aeren d'Cannith\n- ***Major Motivation:*** To discover the true process of the creation of Warforged and what changed between  the originals and the modern creations.\n- Was adopted into House Cannith about 20 years ago at the age of 18 y/o as the Youngest Master Artificer (and only Master Artificer without a Mark of Creation) ever named within the house.\n\t- Due to his invention of the ingenious Everbright Lantern\n- He is now the Mentor to Miri, the magewright currently living in Shavelant.\n- He was always very interested in the warforged and their creation.\n- Aeren knew of Geralt's parents before they died, and knew they were very important.\n\t- He didn't know what they were researching, but he knew it was highly classified.\n- He does not know what Geralt's schematics say, but he knows that they were written in an ancient draconic dialect (**Sibernyan**)\n- He has come across a few pages of his own **(figure to what those pages reveal?)** but has not been able to translate them.\n\n#### Artifacts\n##### Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD) & Fragments\n- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.\n\t- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of their location, and have been hunting them down since.\n\t- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.\n- Contains imprisoned essence of Rak Tulkesh\n- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted\n- Who has them\n\t- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment (taken from Lick in session 1)\n\t- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment\n\t- Hrothgar: 1 fragment, obtained from Draven when Hrothgar battled and killed him\n\n##### Etherseraph\n- The Etherseraph was crafted by Varyn following the Silver Flame's creation.\n- In addition to a powerful weapon, the Etherseraph is a tool:\n\t- The white flame of the Etherseraph will clear the fog of the Mourning and light the way to the Gate of the Silver Flame.\n\t- The Gate is the entrance to the pocket dimension that contains the actual Silver Flame.\n- Over the years, Varyn has gifted it to many people he deemed worthy to carry it, the most notable being Tira Miron, who, years ago, used it to reseal an escaped Overlord and become the Voice of the Silver Flame.\n- Draven Flameforge was another that was trained by Varyn, and gifted the Etherseraph to wield in the name of Siberys.\n- It is now in Hrothgar's possession, obtained when he killed Draven in battle.\n\n##### Steelhardt (The Prototype)\n- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.\n- Geralt's parent knew that the transference would only be successful if balance between all 3 *Aspects of the Progenitors* were maintained.\n\t- **Siberys's aspect:** Light, Divinity\n\t- **Khyber's aspect:** Darkness, Impiety\n\t- **Eberron's aspect:** Materialism, Tangibility\n- Any imbalance of these 3 (like only using a Khyber/Siberys shard without the other) would result in an imbalance of the soul, causing psychosis.\n- Yelena and Norbit created a single prototype that worked fully as intended. They combined Siberys and Khyber dragonshards into the device, which allowed those two aspects to be fulfilled.\n\t- They never wrote down how they manage to combine those two shards into a single device. All other attempts made by Cannith Artificers have always failed, and only one shard can be installed without the device failing, which has caused psychosis in almost all subjects it was originally attempted on.\n\t- Cannith artificers developed a work-around to the psychosis issue: They wipe the soul's memories upon transference to the Warforged body.\n- The LoD seek to use a Steelhardt to transfer Rak Tulkesh's essence from the FKD into a living avatar, so that he could be freed from his bonds and reign over Eberron once again (See Woe's plot pieces).\n\n#### Villains\n\n##### Vorak\n- Vorak was House Cannith's most skilled assassin, loyal to the House for most of his life. Originally a half-elf, he served for over a hundred years until his age forced him out of field work, though he remained a top advisor for covert activities within the House.\n- Voluntarily underwent House Cannith's and the Wolfsbane's very first attempt at using a Steelhardt to transfer a soul to another body.\n- The transfer was partially successful, moving Vorak from his original body to a younger, stronger one from a deceased Cannith soldier.\n- While he retained his memories, his mind quickly became plagued with dark thoughts, his grip on reality slipping, his physical abilities changing.\n- Before he lost his mind completely, Marix pointed him towards the Wolfsbanes, whom he killed save for Geralt, who escaped.\n- He went rogue, and was manipulated by Mordakhesh, who focused Vorak's mind to one objective: destroy the Silver Flame.\n- Bolstered by new dark powers infused into his Steelhardt by Mordakesh, he led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.\n\t- His attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, shutting his mind to outside manipulations and causing the Silver Flame to defend itself by unleashing the dead gray mists, causing the Mourning.\n- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, creating \"Rageblight zones\" that empower him and allow him to resurrect his body if he falls.\n- His Khyber-infused Steelhardt causes him to achieve quasi-lichdom through unique means:\n\t- Vorak is fueled by rage energy he harvests from his victims\n\t- He doesn't transfer his consciousness - instead, he corrupts areas with his presence\n\t- Each village he destroys becomes a \"Rageblight zone\" that strengthens him\n\t- When physically \"killed,\" he disperses into rage energy and reforms at the nearest corrupted area\n- Ritual to defeat him:\n\t- The unlocked [[Legacy Stone]] must be used in a rageblight zone, where it will summon and bind Vorak.\n\t- The Legacy Stone will charge, weakening Vorak until it is ready, when it will then release a pulse of radiant energy, completely disabling Vorak and cleansing his soul.\n\t- Vorak will then momentarily be himself again, before his body is released into death, having been bound to an undead existence for so long.\n\n##### Woe (Cass Lockheed)\n- Was originally a human soldier fighting in the Last war under his commanding officer, Forge.\n- During a battle, he was locked into a duel with Lick's father, who wore a fragment of the *FKD* around his neck.\n- During this duel, Forge set off an explosion that completed their objective, but also killed Forge, Woe, Lick's father, and most others that were involved in this battle.\n- Woe's proximity to the fragment of the *FKD* during his death caused his soul to be tainted, keeping him in 'Limbo' after death.\n- Mordakhesh - led by the Draconic Prophecy - resurrected Woe in a profane ritual that stored his soul into the *FKD*, fusing it with the essence of Rak Tulkesh, and containing it in a Warforged body.\n- This gave him dark powers, sourced from Rak Tulkesh's essence, which is trapped within. The only limit to his power being the remaining FKD fragments that are still out in the world.\n- Woe's soul, now heavily influenced by the Overlord of Rage, works fanatically under Mordakhesh's guidance.\n- ***Motivation:***\n\t- Forge's decision to sacrifice himself and all of his men, including Woe, caused Woe to become extremely hateful to the concept of war. He believes that government and the wars they wage make the world a worse place.\n\t- He seeks to reunite all of the *FKD* fragments and use that power to start and finish the war to end all wars, one that will wipe all forms of government from the planet.\n\n##### Mordakhesh\n- Lieutenant to Rak Tulkhesh\n- Commands the Lords of Dust & performed ritual on Woe\n- Has been hunting the FKD fragments for a long time\n\t- Ever since Varyn went looking for them\n- Has been guiding Woe to seek out the *FKD* fragments, telling him they will give him the power to achieve his own goals\n- Mardakhesh has kept a secret from Woe - the reunification of the FKD and its shards will allow Rak Tulkesh to use Woe's soul as a catalyst - destroying Rak Tulkesh's prison and allowing his avatar to once again claim dominion over Eberron, shattering Woe's soul in the process.\n- Woe's soul is simply the begining to the chain reaction that will free Rak Tulkesh. Once the pieces are reunited, the FKD fragment must be ripped from Woe's soul and joined with Elix's (an untouched soul)\n\n##### Hrothgar \n- Bjorn's brother\n- Usurped Bjorn's position as the Chieftian of the Stormpeak Clan\n- Killed Draven and took his fractured dragonshard fragment and white flameblade, further increasing his power and dark influence on the surrounding land.\n- Can only be cleansed of the dark corruption on his soul via use of the [[Legacy Stone]] after Geralt has learned how to use it, similar to the process for Vorak.\n\n#### Factions\n##### House Cannith\n- The leader of Cannith south is Marix d'Cannith.\n- Marix ordered the use of the Steelhardt in the ritual involving Vorack.\n- He also put the hit out on Geralt's parents.\n\n##### Church of the Silver Flame\n- ***Secret***: Doesn't actually know where the Silver Flame is kept.\n- ***Motivation:*** Find the Silver Flame and claim dominion over it, to protect it.\n- Know of the Boromar Clan's attempts to track down Baelin ir'Torn for the dragonshard fragment.\n- Are working with Baelen trying to locate the Silver Flame, giving him their resources.\n\n##### Boromar clan\n- Seeks the Dragonshard and fragments for none other than the promise of wealth and power\n- Have been tracking Baelen ir'Torn\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Quests & Encounters/Airship Crash.md\nReferences\n- [[#Sigs|Sigs]]\n- [[#Airship|Airship]]\n\t- [[#Airship#Crew|Crew]]\n- [[#Airship Crash|Airship Crash]]\n- [[#Woe & Team|Woe & Team]]\n- [[#After the crash|After the crash]]\n\n---\n## Sigs\n- [[Woe]] and his team of kobolds attack the airship\n- Woe is searching for a fragment from the [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] that Lick is wearing as a necklace.\n- Post-crash scenes of Woe killing Lick and taking his necklace.\n- Jon's home town, [[Shavalant]], is nearby the crash site.\n- Faction introductions (Tyrant changlings of Karrnathi soldiers, Lick boromar clan)\n\n## Lead-in\n[[Session 1 Lead-in|Read to players at the start of the session]]\n\n## Airship\nThe PCs are traveling aboard 'Gyott Byufemitle' (elvish) or 'The Merkentile'\n\n[[The Airship#Mechanics of flying|Flying Mechanics]]\n\nHaving just finished a delivery to [[Fairhaven]], The Merkentile is traveling back to its port in [[Sharn]].\n\nOn the ship are [[Statblocks#Veteran|Veterans]] and [[Statblocks#Commoner|Commoner]] workers.

Captain Marsh's home is a half-day travel west in Shavalant\n\n## Woe & Team\nThe attacking party consist of 1  and 6 [[Statblocks#Pteranodon|Pteranodons]], with 2 [[Statblocks#Kobold|Kobolds]] riding each except for one, which is ridden by the Kobold Scale sorcerer. \n\nThe attacking 'bandits' will target the strongest people first.

Eventually, Woe will fly in, held aloft by magic, and drop a fireball directly on the Khyber Dragonshard holding the elemental, bringing the ship down in a heap of fire and splinters.\n\n## After the crash\n- The crash site is in a forest clearing, with debris and wreckage scattered around. Bodies of crew members and passengers are strewn about.\n- Woe is seen tearing taunting Lick, then killing him with swift efficiency and taking his necklace.\n- Woe flies off after securing what he was after, leaving the Kobolds to do as they wish.\n- There are several kobold warriors scavenging the wreckage for valuables.

The air hums with the energy of a thousand voices, all clamoring, bartering, and calling out greetings or farewells. The station itself is a colossal structure, its high, vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns of dark, polished wood. Enormous everbright lanterns hang from the ceiling, bathing the station in a warm, welcoming glow.\n\nBefore you can even take a breath, you're surrounded by a swarm of people. Porters push their way through the throng, their carts piled high with luggage and crates. Skycoach drivers tout the speed and comfort of their vehicles, hoping to lure travelers to their flying chariots. Guides, their faces eager and hopeful, offer their services to help navigate the labyrinthine city. And of course, there are the inevitable beggars, their pleas for alms blending into the general din.\n\nThrough the crowd, you can see the many shops and stalls that line the edges of the station. House Orien maintains a strong presence here, with offices for arranging transport and shipping, as well as a small enclave for its heirs. House Sivis has a message station here, and House Deneith has a small outpost where you can hire bodyguards or laborers. House Vadalis even operates a large stable and hostelry, should you need to secure your mounts while exploring the city.\n\n**Via land road at Wroann's Gate.**\nAs you approach the colossal entrance to the City of Towers, you begin to understand the depth of its name. A breathtaking panorama of soaring spires and towering structures stretches before you, reaching up into the sky as if to pierce the heavens themselves. The sheer scale of the city is overwhelming, and you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.\n\nThe gate itself is a marvel of engineering, a massive archway carved from black granite and topped by a titanic statue of Queen Wroann of Breland. The queen holds a scepter in one hand and a sword above her head.\n\nThe streets of Wroann's Gate teem with life. Merchants and traders hawk their wares, their voices blending into a cacophony of sound. Travelers from across Khorvaire mingle with the city's residents, their faces reflecting a myriad of cultures and backgrounds. Skycoaches flit through the air like giant dragonflies, carrying passengers to their destinations. And beneath it all, you can hear the constant hum of the Cogs, the beating heart of Sharn's industry.\n\nCrossing the threshold into the impossibly tall city, the first thing that hits you is the smell. It's a complex, ever-shifting blend of a thousand different scents: the tang of smoke and sulfur from the Cogs, the sweet aroma of exotic spices, the stench of sewage and garbage, and the faint but unmistakable fragrance of magic.\n\nThe next thing you notice is the noise. Sharn is a city that never sleeps, and the din of its inhabitants is constant. You hear the shouts of merchants hawking their wares, the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the rhythmic clang of hammers in the Cogs, and the distant roar of the crowds in the entertainment districts. It's a noise that can be overwhelming at first, but it's also a noise that pulsates with life and energy.\n\nYou're struck by the diversity of the city's inhabitants. Humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and even more exotic creatures all rub shoulders in the crowded streets. You see merchants from the Lhazaar Principalities haggling with traders from the Mror Holds. You see warforged laborers hauling goods alongside halfling teamsters. You see goblin families begging for alms, their faces etched with the hardship of life in the lower wards.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Quests & Encounters/Corrupted Grove.md\n- **Objective:** Neutralize or remove the dragonshard to cleanse the grove, possibly through combat with guardians, a ritual, or solving a puzzle related to [[Woe]]'s magic.\n- **Location:** Once-sacred grove, now dying from a dark Khyber dragonshard's influence.\n- **Description:** Trees and plants are twisted, withering with a purple tinge.

The journey in between is where you will decide who Geralt Wolfsbane really is.\n\n**Forge's Reading:**\n> A mind of flesh in a body of steel. You carry the weight of a war you ended and the ghosts of the men you sacrificed. You seek to understand your rebirth before considering the death that brought you there. And now look what you've become. A father without children, a soldier without a war. But a new war is coming, and a ghost from your past now wears the face of the enemy. But be warned, metal man, that in the absence of self awareness, the enemies face may one day look like the one that stares back at you in the mirror.\n\n**Lox's Reading:**\n> You carry a power fueled by righteous grief, a power granted to avenge a stolen future. But the hand that feeds your rage is cloaked in shadow, and the path to your revenge is paved with deception. You hunt a murderer, but you are blind to the true monster. The favor you owe will come due, and you will learn that the price for power is not paid in gold, but in what you value most. In time, you will decide if that is a price worth paying.\n\n**Nyx's Reading:**\n> You mourn a theft of something most pure, and you hear the forest join you in anguish. But the daughter you lost answered a song only she could hear. Your husband's path of righteous vengeance is a gilded cage, and with every step he takes, the bars grow stronger. The fire of his grief is the very heat that forges the key. Be wary, mother, for the debt he must pay will come from you both, and the lock he turns will not open a door to her return, but to His.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Quests & Encounters/Kobold Cave.md\nReferences\n- [[#Sigs|Sigs]]\n- [[#In the cave|In the cave]]\n- [[#Encounters|Encounters]]\n\t- [[#Encounters#Dialogue between 2 kobolds|Dialogue between 2 kobolds]]\n\t- [[#Encounters#Brain's mutterances|Brain's mutterances]]\n- [[#Enemy goals|Enemy goals]]\n\t- [[#Enemy goals#Prophecy Fragment concerning Tiamat|Prophecy Fragment concerning Tiamat]]\n- [[#Treasure|Treasure]]\n- [[#Marsh|Marsh]]\n- [[#Next|Next]]\n\n\n---\n## Sigs\n- Marsh is kept inside the cave, mistaken as a 'dragonkin' to be used in a ritual.\n- '**The Brains**' - a [[Statblocks#Kobold Dragonshield|Kobold Dragonshield]] that is intelligent *for a kobold* and is the one that made the deal with Woe to help him take down the [[The Airship|Merkentile]]\n- This is a faction of Kobolds that worship [[Tiamat]], called the [[Sons of the Daughter of Khyber]]\n\n## In the cave\n- Find familiar bodies (**Karnathi Soldiers**, **Orcish Bartender**)\n- Traps\n- Loot\n- Torture devices and corpses\n- top level + sublevel\n\t- Top: main chamber, disposal/trapped corridor and room, Brain's chamber\n\t- Sublevel: disposal corridor, leading to outside grate.

He observes Woe, who is still recovering from the procedure. With a slight tone of concern mixed with command, Mordakhesh advises, \"Rest now, let the shard’s essence meld with your own. But first, dispose of our uninvited guests.\" This comment is made dismissively, without even a glance at the party, underscoring their perceived insignificance.\n\n**Woe's Awakening**:\n\n- Woe lethargically sits up, his eyes flashing with newly imbued purple energy. He lazily stretches a hand towards a dormant piece of machinery nearby. As his fingers twitch, a burst of purple energy flows from his hand into the machine, which whirs to life, its mechanical eyes glowing with the same ominous purple.\n- He watches with mild interest, a slight smirk on his face, as the machine turns towards the party, ready to attack.\n\n**Combat Dynamics**:\n\n- The enchanted machine, powered by the dragonshard’s essence, aggressively targets the party. Describe the machine’s movements as unnaturally swift and powerful, enhanced by the magical energy.\n- Throughout the fight, as the party manages to damage the machine, Woe, with minimal effort, could casually redirect his energy to enchant other machinery in the room to join the fray, each time causing the cavern to rumble ominously.\n\n**Environmental Collapse and Escape Routes**:\n\n- The ongoing battle and the unstable arcane energy cause the cavern to shake violently. Debris falls, blocking the path they originally took while conveniently opening up another route that leads deeper into the maze of the Kogs and possibly exits near an unexpected part of Sharn.\n- As the party battles or decides to flee, they notice the structural integrity of the cavern degrading, hinting that staying much longer could be fatal.\n\n**The Magic’s Limit and Woe's Disinterest**:\n\n- If the party manages to distance themselves from the animated machinery, perhaps through clever maneuvering or by making a dash for the new escape route, they'll notice the purple energy begins to fade from the machines, causing them to slow and eventually stop, unable to pursue further.\n- Woe assumes the machines have dealt with the party or that they are no longer his problem. He dismisses them from his mind and exits via his own means, perhaps a portal or cloaked in a shroud of shadows, to recover from the ritual’s exertions.\n\n### Conclusion and Aftermath:\n\n- Once safe, the party can regroup and process the sheer power and threat Woe represents. This encounter not only sets up Woe as a formidable foe but also deepens the mystery and danger of what he and Mordakhesh are planning.\n- This experience can lead to new objectives, such as finding ways to counteract or dismantle the dragonshard’s influence, or investigating other areas of Sharn that might hold the key to stopping Woe’s machinations.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Quests & Encounters/The Bag Man.md\n- Originally a cowardly man that got lost in the bag after hiding in one when his party was attacked.\n- Now, lost in the interdimensional space between bags of holding, he hops from bag to bag, seeking out others to drag into the bag with him.\n- Repeating \"Follow my voice\" 3 times into a bag of holding will summon the Bag Man.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Quests & Encounters/Skill Challenge House Fire.md\n**Objective:** Rescue the trapped individuals and minimize damage to the building and its surroundings.\n\n**Successes Needed:** 3-5 successes before 3 failures.

From a young age, Bjorn-Ulfr showed signs of great strength and resilience, surpassing even the most seasoned warriors in the tribe. His towering stature and relentless determination earned him the respect of his people, and it wasn't long before he was seen as a natural leader.\r\n\r\nAs he grew older, Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership qualities became more apparent, and it was clear that he would one day become the chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan. Under his guidance, the clan flourished, becoming a force to be reckoned with in the harsh wilderness. Bjorn-Ulfr's sense of honor and loyalty was unwavering, and he made it a priority to protect his people from external threats while fostering a strong sense of unity among his tribe.\r\n\r\nBjorn-Ulfr had a younger brother, Hrothgar, who was also a formidable warrior but lacked the same moral compass as his older sibling. As the years passed, Hrothgar's ambition and lust for power grew. He became increasingly envious of Bjorn-Ulfr's status and the adoration he received from the clan. Hrothgar's jealousy festered, and he began plotting to usurp his brother's position as chieftain.\r\n\r\nOne fateful night, Hrothgar betrayed his brother, orchestrating a coup against Bjorn-Ulfr and seizing control of the clan through treachery and deceit. Bjorn-Ulfr, who had always been trusting and believed in the inherent goodness of his people, was taken by surprise. Defeated and cast out by his own brother, Bjorn-Ulfr was left to wander the harsh wilderness alone.\r\n\r\nWith the betrayal still fresh in his heart, Bjorn-Ulfr embarked on a path of self-discovery and redemption. He channeled his anger, pain, and loss into becoming an even more formidable warrior, delving into the ways of the barbarian to hone his rage. As he roamed the wild, he formed new alliances and built a following of loyal outcasts and like-minded individuals who sought justice and vengeance against the treacherous Hrothgar.\r\n\r\nBjorn-Ulfr's ultimate goal became to confront his brother and restore the rightful order within the Stormpeak Clan. The memory of the betrayal fueled his determination to bring Hrothgar to justice, not only for his own sake but to reclaim the honor and legacy of their people. Under Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership, his ragtag group of followers would stop at nothing to right the wrongs committed by his own flesh and blood and restore his place as the true chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan.\r\n## Draven Flameforge\r\n### Race & Class\r\n- Blue Dragonborn Paladin\r\n- Lawful Good\r\n### Background\r\n- Acolyte\r\n- Born in Byeshk Mountains\r\n### Backstory\r\nDraven Flameforge was born into the proud and ancient clan of Flameforge, a lineage of dragonborn warriors renowned for their devotion to Siberys, the Dragon Above.

Here is his revised backstory:\r\n\r\nSylas was born in the bustling coastal city of Sharn, where humans and elves coexisted in an uneasy alliance. His father, a reclusive elven scholar, had a fascination with forbidden knowledge and the enigmatic aspects of magic. Sylas's mother was a human merchant who embraced the chaos of the city's underbelly. From her, Sylas learned his first taste of anarchy and rebellion.\r\n\r\nFrom an early age, Sylas displayed an insatiable curiosity for the arcane, an unquenchable thirst for power, and an innate ability to bend others to his will. Though concerned about his son's choices, his father could not deny the potential within him and reluctantly taught Sylas the basics of eldritch magic. Sylas quickly surpassed his father's teachings and delved into darker tomes and rituals, seeking the forbidden secrets that eldritch beings held.\r\n\r\nOne fateful night, during an illicit ritual deep in the city's labyrinthine sewers, Sylas made a pact with the mysterious and enigmatic Traveler. The Traveler granted Sylas otherworldly powers in exchange for his servitude and adherence to its unpredictable whims. Its motives were always veiled in mystery, and its presence brought chaos and intrigue to Sylas's life.\r\n\r\nThe Traveler's influence transformed Sylas into a warlock with the power to manipulate time, reality, and fate. But in return, the Traveler would randomly manifest its presence, whisking Sylas away to alternate realities and planes, often leaving him to navigate unforeseen challenges.\r\n\r\n## Forge\r\nForge was once a human general during the tumultuous times of the Last War. Known for his unwavering commitment to victory, he often made decisions that placed strategic objectives above the lives of his own soldiers. In a pivotal battle, faced with overwhelming odds, he made the fateful choice to detonate an explosion that claimed his life along with his entire squad, effectively turning the tide in his side's favor.\r\n\r\nAfter his death, Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith, a powerful faction renowned for their advancements in magical engineering. They were experimenting with the creation of sentient constructs called warforged—living beings made of metal and magic designed for warfare. Forge's soul was infused into one of these new bodies, and unlike others in the program, he retained his memories and sanity. This unexpected outcome puzzled the artificers, who could not replicate the process successfully with other subjects.\r\n\r\nHeld captive by House Cannith, Forge underwent numerous tests as they sought to understand why he was different. Using his experience and tactical acumen, he eventually orchestrated an escape. In the process, he destroyed the creation forge responsible for his rebirth, dealing a significant blow to House Cannith's operations.\r\n\r\nSince his escape, Forge has been on the run. House Cannith is determined to find him, both to prevent any secrets from being exposed and to continue their research based on his unique transformation. Bearing a distinctive dragonmark emblazoned on his chest—an identifier linking him to House Cannith—he moves cautiously, aware that he is constantly being pursued.\r\n\r\nForge grapples with his new existence, questioning what it means to be alive in a constructed body. He contemplates the ethics of creating more beings like himself. Would bringing others into the world as warforged be an act of creation or manipulation? This internal conflict drives him to seek understanding of his own identity and purpose.\r\n\r\nAmidst a world striving to recover from the devastation of war, Forge searches for a place where he belongs. He is caught between his past as a human general and his present as a warforged fugitive. His journey is one of self-discovery, as he tries to reconcile his actions during the war with his desire to forge a new path forward.\r\n\r\n## **Lox Tempest**\r\n\r\nLox Tempest's life was forever changed by a single moment. As a husband to Nyx and father to their daughter Elix, Lox's world revolved around his small, cherished family.\r\n\r\nBefore tragedy struck, Lox was approached by a mysterious patron who showed him disturbing **visions of the future** - glimpses of danger that would supposedly threaten his family. Convinced by these prophecies and desperate to protect those he loved, Lox made a **pact** that would grant him power beyond ordinary means.\r\n\r\nThe terms were simple yet ominous: Lox would receive his powers, and in return, he would owe a single **favor** to be redeemed when his patron deemed fit. The consequence for failing to perform this favor was equally clear - Lox would lose \"what he values most.\"\r\n\r\nWhen news came that **The Merkantile** had been attacked and his daughter Elix was presumed dead among the passengers, the power he had gained seemed a cruel mockery of his intentions.\r\n\r\nNow consumed by grief and rage, Lox travels alongside his wife Nyx. Their shared loss has bound them in a quest for vengeance, though each pursues it through different means. While Nyx channels her pain through her druidic connection to nature, Lox wields the **dark powers** granted by his pact – abilities that sometimes frighten even him.\r\n\r\nThough the full extent of his capabilities remains to be seen, whispers follow him - of enemies who fall to unseen forces, of bargains struck in moments of desperation. The power flows through him like a cold current, always reminding him of its price.\r\n\r\nDespite the darkness that has entered his life, Lox remains driven by love. His devotion to finding his daughter's killer and protecting what remains of his family gives him purpose. Yet questions haunt him in quiet moments - about the true nature of his unseen patron, about the favor that will eventually be called due, and about whether the power he wields is changing him into something he no longer recognizes.\r\n\r\n## **Nyx Tempest**\r\n\r\n\"Nyx Tempest was born beneath the ancient boughs of the deep forests, where the boundaries between the material world and the Feywild grow thin. As a child of mixed heritage - part wood elf from her mother's lineage and part drow from her father's - Nyx learned early to navigate between different worlds, different perspectives.\r\n\r\nRaised among the **druidic circles** of her mother's people, Nyx developed a profound connection to the natural world. The whispers of leaves, the secrets carried by the wind, and the silent wisdom of ancient trees became her first teachers. She learned to listen to the voice of nature, to recognize its patterns and its magic, and eventually, to channel its power through her own being.\r\n\r\nWhen she met **Lox**, their connection transcended the ordinary. Despite their different backgrounds and approaches to the world, they found in each other a sense of belonging that neither had experienced before. Their union blessed them with a **daughter, Elix**, who embodied the best of them both - Nyx's innate connection to the natural world and Lox's passionate intensity.\r\n\r\nFor years, they built a life together, finding a balance between Nyx's communion with nature and Lox's increasingly protective stance toward their family. When Lox began to change - speaking of **visions** and demonstrating abilities that seemed to stem from something beyond the natural world - Nyx felt concern but trusted in the love that bound them together.\r\n\r\nTheir world shattered when Elix was to travel alone for the first time, aboard an airship called **The Merkantile**. The attack on the vessel and the presumed loss of their daughter tore through Nyx's heart like wildfire through a drought-stricken forest. Her grief manifested in her druidic powers, transforming her once-nurturing magic into something that could equally heal or harm.\r\n\r\nNow Nyx travels alongside Lox, united by loss yet sometimes divided by their methods of seeking justice. While Lox draws upon the **darker powers** granted by his mysterious patron, Nyx channels her anguish through her connection to nature - calling upon storms when her heart rages, or coaxing healing blooms from barren soil in rare moments of hope.\r\n\r\nDespite her pain, Nyx remains a **healer at heart**, capable of great compassion. She watches Lox with a mixture of love and concern, aware of how his pact has changed him and uncertain of where his new path might lead them both. Yet their shared goal keeps them bound together - to discover the truth about what happened aboard The Merkantile, to find those responsible, and perhaps, though she scarcely dares hope, to discover that their beloved Elix might somehow still be found.\"\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 0 Plans.md\n# Essentials to be Discussed\n- How often you're gonna play - 1/week\n- Where you're gonna play - Jared's Apt\n- How much time will each session last on average 3-4 hrs\n\n# The World\n- What's the setting that the story will be set in\n- Notable locations, races, and people\n\t- Sharn, the City of Towers\n\t- 5 Nations\n\t- Anywhere the players are from\n- Other notable information about the world\n\t- Dragonmarks and marked houses\n- Class or race restrictions\n\t- case-by-case, most are allowed\n\n# The Campaign\n- Estimated campaign length\n- Which books from the system are allowed\n\t- All core rules, XGtE, TCoE, VGtM, MToF, FToD\n- Genre & tone of the campaign\n\t- Noir, political intrigue, gray morality, fantasy adventure\n- Emphasis on combat & roleplaying\n\t- Even mix, typically options for either (not always)\n- Level of campaign difficulty\n\t- Death is a reality, encounters range in difficulty\n# The DM Style\n- Rules flexibility\n- Roam flexibility\n- Experience/reward distribution\n- Expectation of consequences\n- Balance changes\n\t- Journal\n- Homebrew material\n\t- Journal\n- Restrictions\n\n# In-Game Topics\nDisruptive topics or actions\nIn-game expectations from players and from the DM\nMetagaming\nRules debates\nHandling problematic situations\nCharacter deaths\nPlayer vs Player situations\nIn-game house rules\n\n# Out-of-Game Topics\nDisruptive topics or situations\nOut-of-game expectations from players and from the DM\nRequired session equipment\nAlcohol & drugs\nMobile phone use and distractions during play\nCommitment\nPlayer Absences\nSnacks\nOut-of-game house rules\n\n# Character Creation\n- 4d6 drop lowest choose attribute\n- Race\n- Class\n- Background\n- Core character design\n- Goals/Motivation\n- Rumors\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 1 Lead-in.md\n Dried blood cakes Khorvaire like topsoil, giving way to the blooming flowers of greed, selfishness, and violence. Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. \n\n102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. \n\nBlood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.\n\nPowerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. \n\nHouse Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.\n\nWith no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.\n\nThen 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. \n\nThe signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.\n\nStill, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.\n\nOur story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. \n\nDeckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.\n\nThe smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.\n\nA tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. \n\nBjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 1 Recap.md\n# Events (in order)\n1.

Colorful flowers blow in the wind. A cloaked figure stands tall with his back to Lox, his hands clasped behind his back. His hands are his only feature not shrouded in a cloak, and they appear to be human.\n\t- Mordakhesh requests a favor from Lox.\n\t\t- *\"During your travels you will encounter a...

The party can help by using magic to heal the horses, by making a DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to calm and encourage them, or by helping to pull the cart themselves with a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.                                             |\n| The \"Helpful\" Traveler | The party meets a lone traveler, a charismatic human named Rhys, who offers to share his campfire and food.

Rhys's goal is to steal the parties valuables while they sleep, then flee. |\n| Rageblight Refugees    | The party encounters a small, desperate group of refugees fleeing the destruction of Galethspyre.

He is fanatically loyal to the Silver Flame but is also a pragmatist. He can reveal the Church's motivations: they believe the FKD fragments are a prison for an Overlord. Which overlord is lost to history, but either way they are too dangerous to be left unaccounted for.\n\t\t- Baelin's initial research revealed they can have a corrupting effect in specific circumstances\n\t\t- The warforged ([[Woe]]) has made several attempts at collecting their FKD while they were protecting Baelin.\n\t\t- If the fragments are reunited within a pure avatar, the Overlord will be unleashed.\n\t\t\t- *Foreshadowing:* Elix is the pure sacrifice that Mordakhesh intends to unleash Rak Tulkesh within.\n\t- **Loot:**\n\t\t- [[Scepter of Madness|Inquisitor Thale's Scepter of Madness]]\n\t\t- Thorin Voss's armor (*+1 Plate Armor*)\n\t\t- 450 gp from the squad members.\n\n- [ ] **Moment 1: _The Road to Galethspyre_**\n\t- As the party travels, the environment becomes more unsettling.\n\t- **Environmental Clues:** They find abandoned refugee camps and warning totems made of bone and red cloth. A mile marker for Galethspyre has been defaced with \"TURN BACK\" and \"FEAR THE BROTHERS GIANT.\"\n\t- **NPC Encounter:** In some roadside ruins, the party finds **Marta Vex**, the former Watch Captain of Galethspyre. She is armed but starving and distrustful.\n\t\t> \"It wasn't a storm... it was a creature. A single, hulking thing of pure rage. And after it was done, the thing just turned to mist and disappeared\n\t\t> It didn't just destroy our town, it filled it with its own madness. \n\t\t> At night, the mist... it's his anger, and it makes good people turn on each other.\"\n\n- [ ] **Moment 2: _Arrival in Galethspyre_**\n\t- The town is eerily quiet during the day. A few members of the **Red Hands Gang** are looting the ruins. This can be a combat or stealth encounter.\n\t- **Enemy Roster:**\n\t\t- 2 Bugbear Thugs\n\t\t- 2 Worgs\n\t\t- 1 Goblin Boss (scout leader)\n\n- [ ] **Moment 3: _Exploring the Blight_**\n\t- **Gilded Grass Apothecary:** Inside the ransacked building sits a frantic and terrified [[Bernard McOogle]]. He explains that his mentor, [[Kynes Lawford]], was taken by the Red Hands Gang. He pleads with the party to rescue him, as Kynes is the only one who can help Geralt.\n\t- **The Broken Mast Tavern:** Now a forward base for the Red Hands Gang. The party may overhear bandits complaining about the \"rage mist\" at night and their giant leaders.\n\t- **Town Hall:** The first building hit by the Rageblight. Death and decay overlays the floor here.\n\t- **The Statue:** A destroyed statue of \"The Thane\" sits in the middle of the town, splintered and destroyed, with a massive path of destruction leading into the north west part of town. A DC 14 Investigation check reveals the damage was caused by a single, powerful entity, not an army or natural disaster.\n\n- [ ] **Moment 4: _The Red Hands' Camp_**\n\t- If the party follows tracks from the tavern or information from Bernard, they can find the main bandit camp in the nearby **Old Thane's Mine**.\n\t- **The Brothers Giant:** The camp is run by **Garspaachi** (frost giant) and **Bruno** (fire giant), who act like surprisingly civil mob bosses. They have Kynes Lawford treating their wounded.\n\t- **Negotiation:** The giants are business-minded. They left their old home because of Hrothgar's corruption and are looking for work. They might release Kynes for a price (money, a magic item, information) or a favor.\n\t\t> **Garspaachi:** \n\t\t> \"So, you're the ones stirrin' up my boys. Bad for business.\n\t\t> Tell us... what's the score in the world outside this ruin? A crew like ours could be very... useful... to the right people.\"\n\t\t> **Bruno:** *unintelligible retard sounds and bursts of flame*\n\t- They can offer Bjorn information about Hrothgar and the corrupted land near the Stormpeak Clan.\n\n- [ ] **Session End: _The Red Mist Rises_**\n\t- As dusk falls, a crimson mist seeps from the ground, filling the streets. The cries of enraged survivors and bandits echo through the ruins.\n\t- Any creature exposed to the mist must make a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** at the start of their turn. On a failure, they are overcome with rage for 1 minute, gaining advantage on melee attack rolls but having disadvantage on all ability checks. They must attack the nearest creature.\n\n### Location Details\n\nPlace 1: _Galethspyre_\n- A small fishing village devastated by the Rageblight a few weeks ago. Buildings are collapsing, and a sense of dread hangs in the air.\n- **Key Locations:**\n\t- *The Gilded Gill Apothecary:* A two-story building, mostly intact but ransacked. \n\t- *The Broken Mast Tavern:* Now a makeshift base for the Red Hands Gang.\n\t- *Town Hall:* Contains records of the town's slow descent into madness before its fall.\n\n### People\n\nPerson 1: *Korven Thale*\n*Session Information*\n- Captured by the party.

His superiors will not be pleased and may escalate their methods to retrieve the FKD fragment.\n\nPerson 2: *Kynes Lawford*\n*Session Information*\n- A skilled but eccentric healer who is the party's only hope of saving Geralt. He is more interested in rare herbs than politics or danger.\n*Plot Information*\n- He is unaffiliated with any major faction but his skills are rare and valuable, making him a person of interest to many.\n\nPerson 3: *Marta Vex*\n*Session Information*\n- The sole surviving authority figure from Galethspyre. Traumatized but resilient, she can offer tactical information about the town layout, survivor locations, and bandit patrols.\n*Plot Information*\n- She witnessed the Rageblight's arrival and can describe a large, monstrous figure leading the attack, providing a clue about Vorak's nature.\n\n### Plot Actions\n\nAction 1: *Vorak's Influence (The Rageblight)*\n- Goal: N/A (passive effect)\n- The Rageblight zone around Galethspyre acts as a constant environmental threat. The red mist at night will turn the town into a free-for-all warzone, making simple tasks incredibly dangerous and complicating any fight the party gets into.\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 3 Plans.md\n### Outline\n- Give handouts (character sheets, Geralt's schematics, quest cards when they come up). \n\t- Have Eric create Geralt's rumors\n- Draven begins having an evolving reoccurring dream about his death\n- Finish looting the Cave\n- [[Shavalant]]\n\t- Meet Prissy and Miri\n\t- Learn about the need for papers to enter Sharn\n\t- Miri requests help with the aqueduct\n\t- Miri uses sending stone to potentially contact Aeren d'Cannith for papers\n\t- Hear rumors about a nearby town going quiet.\n- Introduction of the [[Boromar Gang Members]]\n\t- Either through [[Aquefukt]], roadside encounter, or [[Boromar Gang Campsite]]\n\t- Learn of their search for [[Professor Baelen ir'Torn]]\n\n### Moments\n\n**Moment 1**\n- Situation: The party enters Shavalant, describe the atmosphere and any notable sights.\n- Encounter: Introduce Prissy and Miri, Prissy in her shop, Miri attaching a note to the town bulletin\n- Character Moments: Provide an opportunity to get to know Prissy and Miri, allowing players to engage in some roleplaying.\n\n**Moment 2**\n- Situation: The party finds out that livestock have been disappearing, and blood trails have been found leading through the woods.\n- Character Moments: The party is encouraged to ask Prissy about it, who may offer advice or potions of acid resistance.\n- Encounter: The [[Whitehorn Wood]] quest.\n\n**Moment 3**\n- Situation: Miri gets the party to help her with [[Aquefukt]].

realm of wonder, where magic fuses with technology, creating a world of boundless opportunity and constant conflict. It's a land shaped by the scars of a devastating war, where the lines between good and evil blur, and every corner hides untold stories.\n\n### Description\n\n>Imagine a world where towering cities of shimmering spires rise amidst lush, untamed wilderness. Airships glide through the sky, while lightning rails traverse the vast continents. Eberron is a melting pot of cultures, where mystical creatures coexist with humans in an uneasy balance.

Its radiance pierced the darkness, driving back the forces of evil and offering solace to the righteous.\"\n\n*\"On the Ethereal Chains: The Pursuit of Life Beyond Death\"*\n\t\"The quest for immortality often leads down a path shadowed by ethereal chains. Ancient scholars posited the existence of a soul's anchor—a phylactery—yet, warned of its tether to undeath. A new school of thought, however, seeks the dawn beyond this twilight. Imagine an ethereal crucible, not for ensnaring the soul in a cycle of undeath, but as a bastion for the living essence. A vessel, perhaps, that might harbor the spark of life eternal, untainted by necrosis. Such are the whispers of alchemists and arcanists alike, dreaming of a future where life knows no end.\"\n\n*\"~~Khyber's Darkness: A Study of the Draconic Prophecy~~\"*\n    \"The fragments of ~~Khyber~~, born ~~from the Dragon Below~~, hold untold power. When ~~united~~ they have the potential to unleash great ~~darkness~~ upon the world. The Draconic ~~Prophecy speaks~~ of a time when the fragments shall align, and the forces of ~~shadow~~ will rise once more.\"\n\n*\"The Argent Grimoire: Teachings of the Silver Flame\"*\n    \"Those who follow the path of the Silver Flame must embody its virtues: courage, sacrifice, and unwavering devotion. Through faith and righteous action, the followers of the Flame become beacons of hope in a world beset by darkness. Their magic, fueled by the Flame's radiance, is a potent weapon against the forces of evil.\"\n\n*\"The Shattered Shard: An Account of the Last War\"*\n     \"During the Last War, the nations of Khorvaire clashed in a brutal conflict that reshaped the face of the continent. Amidst the chaos, a great cataclysm struck: the Mourning. The once-mighty nation of Cyre was consumed by a mysterious mist, leaving only the blasted wasteland now known as the Mournland. The cause of this tragedy remains unknown, but rumors persist of dark magic and forbidden experiments gone awry.\"\n\n*\"The Annals of House Cannith\"*\n    \"House Cannith, bearer of the Mark of Making, has long been at the forefront of arcane innovation. Their creations, from the majestic warforged to the convenience of the Everbright lantern, have shaped the course of history.\n\n*\"The Flame's Sacrifice: A Martyr's Tale\"*\n    \"Tira Miron, a paladin of the Silver Flame, faced a terrible choice. To save the world from a great evil, she willingly offered herself as a vessel for the Flame's power. In a blinding flash of radiance, Tira ascended, becoming one with the Silver Flame. Her sacrifice stands as a testament to the depths of devotion and the unyielding spirit of those who serve the Flame.\"\n\n*\"The Mimic: How to Identify a Lurking Threat\"*\n\tIts a mimic.\n\n---\n\n###### Note.\n> Found this on my way back from mission trip in Wroat.

The air here is warm, and as it feels like pine needles as it rushes past you. It smells of wet stone and dank moss. \n\n>  A bright, silver fire emanates from a pulsing purple gem, illuminating the temple from the far side of you, casting you in dim light. Thick columns of cracked marble line this place in multiple rows, acting as supports that hold up the vaulted ceiling. Many runes have been chiseled out of the columns, but the wear of time has made them almost completely unreadable. All you can make out is \"Temple - Endless - Rage\".\n\n> Rows of well kept wooden pews line both sides of a walkway that leads to the flame. As you take in the vastness of this temple, its centerpiece demands your attention. An enormous pit sits 15ft in front of you. Its depth so vast and dark it swallows any light that dare enter it.\n\n> It has a sort of alluring pull to it that gets stronger the closer you get. Almost as if its calling to you, reaching out to your very soul with a single word... \"CLOSER\".\n\n# Notable Locations\n- The Endless: The pit that sits in the middle of this timeless temple is actually the largest entrance to *Shavarath*, the demiplane of **Rak Tulkesh**.

You've accurately connected Kismet's cryptic words to the specific plot points, characters, and artifacts within your campaign notes. This is a great foundation.\n\nHere are a few tips to make it even stronger:\n\n*   **Embrace Double Meanings:** Some phrases can have multiple layers. For instance, Bjorn's \"two shattered legacies\" refers to the FKD and the Legacy Stone, but it could also refer to the legacy of his clan under his rule versus under Hrothgar's. Highlighting these potential dualities can make the prophecy feel even more profound.\n*   **Focus on Player Experience:** Remember that these readings are seeds planted for your players. Each reveal that connects back to this moment will be a satisfying payoff for them. You've created some great potential \"aha!\" moments.\n*   **Thematic Resonance:** The readings effectively tie into your campaign's themes of corrupted good, legacy, and the true nature of evil. This isn't just plot foreshadowing; it's thematic foreshadowing, which is a hallmark of great storytelling.\n\nOverall, this is very well done. The prophecies are evocative and tightly woven into your narrative. Keep up the great work.",
