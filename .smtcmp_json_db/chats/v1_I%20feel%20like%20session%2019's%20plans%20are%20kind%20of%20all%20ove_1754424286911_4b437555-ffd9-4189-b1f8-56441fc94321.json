He asked the party to leave, and payed for another horse they could ride out of town.\n\t- He is concered for the same reasons Miri is, though he is less grateful towards the party than her.\n- The PCs stopped by Prissy's apothecary on the way out, and she gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth as thanks for delivering news of her son's passing (which happened in session 1).",
