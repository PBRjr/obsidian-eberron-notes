Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. \r\n\r\n102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. \r\n\r\nBlood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.\r\n\r\nPowerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. \r\n\r\nHouse Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.\r\n\r\nWith no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.\r\n\r\nThen 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. \r\n\r\nThe signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.\r\n\r\nStill, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.\r\n\r\nOur story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. \r\n\r\nDeckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.\r\n\r\nThe smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.\r\n\r\nA tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. \r\n\r\nBjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 1 Recap.md\n# Events (in order)\r\n1.

Pesonality, theme\r\n\t* Traditional mafia gangers - could be fun, easy to roleplay, fun twist (traditionally violent monsters acting in a well-organized Italian mob)\r\n\t* Galethspyre - Destroyed town, probably a few weeks ago\r\n\t\t* Red mist permeates the outside of the town at night, the inside of broken buildings the only safe place.\r\n\t\t* Any creature caught in the mists at night become fueled by rage, attacking anything in sight\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 19 Recap.md\n## Attendance\n\n| Players | Attendance |\n| ------- | ---------- |\n| Bjorn   | n          |\n| Draven  | y          |\n| Forge   | n          |\n| Geralt  | y          |\n| Lox     | y          |\n| Nyx     | y          |\n**How were the PC's handled for those not in attendance?**\nBjorn's & Forge's PC kinda phased into the background for the session, I didn't have a good excuse for them being gone.\n\n## To-do for next session\n* Need to have an answer ready for if Forge has a crystal in him like the one Geralt has.\n* Figure out how to take back the railroading of the party not having enough time to make it to the mountains.\n\t* Maybe Hank tells them of a path they can take to get there, but will only reach it if the forgo rest for a few nights.\n\t* Or I could just tell them that as the DM.\n\t* I feel bad for railroading them into the town quests.\n* Need to really iron out how Geralt will be cured of his curse. Need to review my notes. Does Varyn show him a ritual to clense Geralt, which could then also be used to cleanse Vorak?\n* He will show them how to perform the Legacy Stone ritual that will later be used on Vorak. This ritual free's the consciousness from the crystal, giving it ghostly body. It gains power, and becomes aggressive.\n\n## Events of the session summarized:\nInterrogated Korvin Thale\n* Learned that the FKD fragments contain the consciousness of Rak Tulkesh\n* Geralt asked Korvin about Varyn, who didn't know who that is\n* Draven had a memory of training with Varyn as a young boy with wooden swords\n* Lox had his Kismet reading and had flashbacks to meeting Nyx, having their kid, and his meetings with his patron\n* Lox has the crazy idea of forcing one of the CotSF higher-ups take over his pact for him\\\n\t* I don't think he will pursue this route\n* They let Korven Thale go with the understanding that the church will still pursue the party, and that Korven will continue to follow his orders.\n\t* The party said they would think about giving the FKD over to the church but made no promises.\n\nAeren & Baelin told the party that they were going to travel to Shavalant to meet back up with Miri and form a new base of operations there.  They will take Piston with them as well.\n* They were concerned for their own safety should they continue to travel with the party.\n* The party asked Aeren to create a combat-focused robot similar to piston for them when he arrives at Shavalant.\n\t* The party wants it named \"Delamane\"\n\t* Aeren happily agreed to it, and said he would begin work on it as soon as he arrived.\n\t* Forge is going to travel with Aeren & Baelin to make sure they arrive safely. He took a horse with them.\n\nThey traveled onward to Galethspyre, and met Marta Vex on the way.\n* The party gave her some food becasue she seemed haggard and worn.\n* She gave all the information she had to the party about the town and the red mists.\n* She asked the party to check in on her \"friend\" (her lover) Bernard McOogle\n\nThey entered Galethspyre, witnessed the public trial of Jakob and his lashings.\n* Talked to Hank & Chef Nyla after a physical encounter with some goblins of the Red Hands Gang.\n* Hank told the party they are welcome to stay in the Broken Mast Tavern tonight and speak to Hank in more detail of the events that transpired in the town.\n* After Hank & Chef Nyla left, the party cut down Jakob and asked him some questions. He told them about the gang, how Nyla is a good person whos trying her best, and that they need to be weary of Hank.\n* He also mentioned that the gang took Jakob and Nyla to their main camp at the Old Thane's Mine.\n\t* Chef Nyla returned, but Kynes never did.\n\nThe party traveled to the Gilded Grass Apothecary and met Bernard McOogle\n* Spoke to Bernard - he was acting crazy, who was definitely kinda high and quite paranoid\n* Didn't give them a ton of great info\n* The party told him that Marta was OK, and that she is traveling to Shavalant.\n* Lox gave him a dreamlily flower for fun and told him to give it to Marta when he sees her.\n\nGeralt asked about how long it would take to get to the peak of the Byeshk Mountains\n* I told him he wouldn't have enough time to make it to the peak before his curse takes hold.\n* See To-do\n\nThey arrived at the Broken Mast Tavern @ approximately 2:30pm\n* Saw Gnolls and goblins feasting and the bard playing frantically.\n* Hank came and disiplined the feasters, telling them they need to ration more food. They didn't listen.\n* Hank invited the party back to his room/office to speak.\n\nSession ended there\n\n\n```\n```Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 18 plans.md\n### Outline\n\n- Decision point: Bandit camp vs Wroat pursuit\n- Galethspyre investigation (destroyed by Rageblight)\n- Red Hands Gang\n- [[Wroat]]\n\n\n### Moments & Encounters\n\n- [ ] Session Start: _Railway Aftermath_\n\t- Geralt has another vision from the [[Legacy Stone]], finally unlocking it, causing him to go into a coma that is not healable by the players\n\t- *Forge* is following the party via a small tracking device he placed on Piston before. He knows that the party got on a lightning rail, then stopped for a short time at the railway station, then continued on to Wroat (because piston was left in the freight car). \n\n- [ ] Random Encounters: *Purification Squad*\n\t> \"By the divine mandate of the Keeper of the Flame Jaela Daran, you will surrender the corrupted shard.

The ropes on one side have been cut, and the bridge is impassable. The party must find a way to cross the river. Repairing the bridge will require a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Intelligence (Investigation) check and will take about an hour. Swimming across the turbulent water requires a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check, with failure resulting in being carried 50 feet downstream.     |\n| Brelish Checkpoint     | The party encounters a heavily armed checkpoint manned by the Brelish Military. The soldiers are on high alert following the chaos in Sharn and are questioning everyone passing through. They will ask the party for their travel papers and their reason for traveling. A successful DC 14 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check will allow the party to pass without incident. Failure may lead to a tense standoff or combat.                                                                       |\n| Exhausted Caravan      | The party finds a merchant from House Orien whose caravan is stuck. His two horses are exhausted and refuse to move. The merchant, a friendly half-elf named Elara, will offer the party 50 gp to help her get the caravan moving again. The party can help by using magic to heal the horses, by making a DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to calm and encourage them, or by helping to pull the cart themselves with a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.                                             |\n| The \"Helpful\" Traveler | The party meets a lone traveler, a charismatic human named Rhys, who offers to share his campfire and food. Rhys is secretly thief and is trying to lull the party into a false sense of trust. He will be friendly and helpful, offering the party some wine from his 'personal stash'. Drinking the wine will has the effect of the Sleep spell. Those that aren't affected by Sleep will instead gain 1 level of exhaustion. Rhys's goal is to steal the parties valuables while they sleep, then flee. |\n| Rageblight Refugees    | The party encounters a small, desperate group of refugees fleeing the destruction of Galethspyre. They are starving and distrustful of strangers. They can share harrowing tales of the red mists and the unnatural rage that consumed their friends and neighbors. A successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check will convince them the party means no harm, and they might share what little food they have.                                                                                            |\n| Abandoned Waystation   | On the side of the road is a little abandoned waystation.

She is fanatically loyal to the Silver Flame but is also a pragmatist. He can reveal the Church's motivations: they believe the FKD fragments are a prison for an Overlord. Which overlord is lost to history, but either way they are too dangerous to be left unaccounted for.\n\t\t- Baelin's initial research revealed they can have a corrupting effect in specific circumstances\n\t\t- The warforged ([[Woe]]) has made several attempts at collecting their FKD while they were protecting Baelin.\n\t\t- If the fragments are reunited within a pure avatar, the Overlord will be unleashed.\n\t\t\t- *Foreshadowing:* Elix is the pure sacrifice that Mordakhesh intends to unleash Rak Tulkesh within.\n\t- **Loot:**\n\t\t- [[Scepter of Madness|Inquisitor Thale's Scepter of Madness]]\n\t\t- Thorin Voss's armor (*+1 Plate Armor*)\n\t\t- 450 gp from the squad members.\n\n- [x] **Moment 1: _The Road to Galethspyre_**\n\t- As the party travels, the environment becomes more unsettling.\n\t- **Environmental Clues:** They find abandoned refugee camps and warning totems made of bone and red cloth. A mile marker for Galethspyre has been defaced with \"THE FOG COMES AT NIGHT\" and \"FEAR THE BROTHERS GIANT.\"\n\t- **NPC Encounter:** In a roadside camp the party finds **Marta Vex**, the former Watch Captain of Galethspyre. She is unarmed and starving and distrustful.\n\t\t> \"It was like a storm, but it wasn't... it was a creature. A single, hulking thing of pure rage. And after it was done, the thing just turned to mist and disappeared\"\n\t\t> \"It didn't just destroy our town, it filled it with its own madness.\"\n\t\t> At night, the mist... it's his anger, and it makes good people turn on each other.\"\n\n- [x] **Moment 2: _Arrival in Galethspyre_**\n\t- The town is eerily quiet during the day. A few members of the **Red Hands Gang** are looting the ruins. They don't seek trouble, just keep an eye on the party.\n\t- People can be seen darting into homes.\n\n- [x] Moment 2a: Public Trial\n\t- A public \"trial\" is being held by the leader of the town, *[[Chef Nyla]]*. \n\t\t- She is prosecuting the town baker, *Jakob*, for baking a batch of bread that made people sick. She gives out lashings.\n\t\t- A Human Bookkeeper, *[[Hank]]*, is seen by her side during the trial, ushering her on.\n\t\t\t- He is the bookkeeper for the Red Hand's Gang, and is running operations in Galethspyre\n\t\n- [x] **Moment 3: _Exploring the Blight_**\n\t- **Gilded Grass Apothecary:** Inside the ransacked building sits a frantic and terrified [[Bernard McOogle]]. He explains that his mentor, [[Kynes Lawford]], was taken by the Red Hands Gang. He pleads with the party to rescue him, as Kynes is the only one who can help Geralt.\n\n\t- **The Broken Mast Tavern:** Now a forward base for the Red Hands Gang. The party may overhear bandits complaining about the \"rage mist\" at night and their giant leaders.\n\n\t- **The Tunnels:** Where the surviving members of the town reside at night.\n\t\t- Leader: [[Chef Nyla]]\n\t\t- Primary problem: Low on supplies, which are hoarded in the Broken Mast Tavern by the Red Hands Gang. Can give party a map with entrances to the tavern.\n\t\t- Secondary Problem: Healer Kynes Lawford was kidnapped. Speak to Bernard McOogle\n\n\t- **Town Hall:** The first building hit by the Rageblight. Death and decay overlays the floor here.\n\t- **The Statue:** A destroyed statue of \"The Thane\" sits in the middle of the town, splintered and destroyed, with a massive path of destruction leading into the north west part of town. A DC 14 Investigation check reveals the damage was caused by a single, powerful entity, not an army or natural disaster.\n\n- [ ] **Moment 4: _The Red Hands' Camp_**\n\t- If the party follows tracks from the tavern or information from Bernard, they can find the main bandit camp in the nearby **Old Thane's Mine**.\n\t- **The Brothers Giant:** The camp is run by **Garspaachi** (frost giant) and **Bruno** (fire giant), who act like surprisingly civil mob bosses. They have Kynes Lawford treating their wounded.\n\t- **Negotiation:** The giants are business-minded. They left their old home because of Hrothgar's corruption and are looking for work. They might release Kynes for a price (money, a magic item, information) or a favor. [[Favors]]\n\t\t> **Garspaachi:** \n\t\t> \"So, you're the ones stirrin' up my boys. Bad for business.\"\n\t\t> **Bruno:** *unintelligible retard sounds and bursts of flame*\n\t- They can offer Bjorn information about Hrothgar and the corrupted land near the Stormpeak Clan.\n\n- [ ] **Session End: _The Red Mist Rises_**\n\t- As dusk falls, a crimson mist seeps from the ground, filling the streets. The cries of enraged survivors and bandits echo through the ruins.\n\t- Any creature exposed to the mist must make a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** at the start of their turn. On a failure, they are overcome with rage for 1 minute, gaining advantage on melee attack rolls but having disadvantage on all ability checks. They must attack the nearest creature.\n\n### Location Details\n\nPlace 1: _Galethspyre_\n- A small fishing village devastated by the Rageblight a few weeks ago. Buildings are collapsing, and a sense of dread hangs in the air.\n- **Key Locations:**\n\t- *The Gilded Gill Apothecary:* A two-story building, mostly intact but ransacked. \n\t- *The Broken Mast Tavern:* Now a makeshift base for the Red Hands Gang.\n\t- *Town Hall:* Contains records of the town's slow descent into madness before its fall.\n\n### People\n\nPerson 1: *Korven Thale*\n*Session Information*\n- Captured by the party. He is a zealot but not suicidal. He can be interrogated for information on the Church's knowledge of the FKD and their fear of the Lords of Dust.\n*Plot Information*\n- His capture is a significant blow to the Church's local operations. His superiors will not be pleased and may escalate their methods to retrieve the FKD fragment.\n\nPerson 2: *Kynes Lawford*\n*Session Information*\n- A skilled but eccentric healer who is the party's only hope of saving Geralt.

He asked the party to leave, and payed for another horse they could ride out of town.\r\n\t- He is concered for the same reasons Miri is, though he is less grateful towards the party than her.\r\n- The PCs stopped by Prissy's apothecary on the way out, and she gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth as thanks for delivering news of her son's passing (which happened in session 1).\r\n- They read the intel letter concernig Baelen and his group of CotSF guards and planned on heading to Sharn, with a possible detour to Castle Arakhain (AKA \"The Lighthouse\") to investigate a potential lead on the purple crystal he has, hoping to discover more about Woe.\r\n\r\nDuring first day of travel they completed the \"It's Kismet\" encounter.\r\n- Helped her repair her wagon using some glue she had.\r\n- She announced herself as a seer and offered palm readings.

Make a Deal with the Brothers Giant\n\nThe party could negotiate with Hank to use the motorcycles. Hank, acting on behalf of the Brothers Giant, might demand a favor in return.\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 20 Plans.md\" language=\"markdown\">\n<!-- ... existing content ... -->\n### Moments & Encounters\n\n- [ ] Session Start: *Speaking with Hank*\n- The party is in the Broken Mast Tavern speaking with Hank.\n- **Goal:** Geralt needs a way to reach the Byeshk mountains in less than 4 days.\n- **Negotiation:** Hank is willing to lend the motorcycles if the party clears out the lower levels of the Old Thane's Mine, which have become infested with dangerous creatures, making it unsafe for his gang.\n\n- [ ] Encounter: *Clearing the Mine*\n- The party travels to the Old Thane's Mine to clear out the infestation.\n- **Location:** A dark, abandoned mine shaft with unstable tunnels (risk of cave-ins) and thick webbing.\n- **Enemies:** A nest of 3 **[[Phase Spiders]]** and their hatchlings (**Swarms of Spiders**). The Phase Spiders use the Ethereal Plane to ambush the party in the narrow tunnels.\n- **Reward:** Upon their return, Hank grants them use of the motorcycles.\n\n- [ ] Moment 2: *Name*\n<!-- ... existing content ... -->\n</smtcmp_block>\n\n#### 2. Help the Townspeople for a Secret Route\n\nThe party could align with Chef Nyla. She might know of a secret, faster route to the mountains that avoids the main roads, but she'll need the party's help first.\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Campaign Notes/Story/Sessions/Session 20 Plans.md\" language=\"markdown\">\n<!-- ... existing content ... -->\n### Moments & Encounters\n\n- [ ] Session Start: *Speaking with Hank*\n- The party is in the Broken Mast Tavern speaking with Hank.\n- **Goal:** Geralt needs a way to reach the Byeshk mountains in less than 4 days.\n\n- [ ] Moment: *An Alliance with Nyla*\n- The party speaks with Chef Nyla, who is hiding with other survivors. She knows of an old, dangerous smuggler's path through the foothills that will cut their travel time significantly.\n- **The Price:** She will only reveal the path if the party secures a wagon of food and medical supplies from the Red Hands' stockpile in the Broken Mast Tavern.\n- **Challenge:** The party must create a distraction to lure the guards away from the tavern's storeroom, then succeed on a group DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check to load and escape with the wagon.\n\n- [ ] Moment 2: *The Smuggler's Path*\n- Nyla provides a map to the secret path. The journey will involve a skill challenge to navigate treacherous terrain and avoid natural hazards.\n\n- [ ] Session End: *Name*\n<!-- ... existing content ... -->\n</smtcmp_block>",
