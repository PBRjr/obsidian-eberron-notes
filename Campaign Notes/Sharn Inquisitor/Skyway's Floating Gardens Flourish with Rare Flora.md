In a delightful spectacle of nature's resilience, Skyway's floating gardens have become home to a rare species of luminescent flowers, previously thought to be native only to the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. The flowers, known as Starlight Blossoms, have begun to bloom in the high towers of [[Sharn]], casting an enchanting glow over the city's skyline.

The sudden appearance of these flowers has sparked mild curiosity among the citizens and a few scholarly debates in [[Morgrave University|Morgrave University's]] hallowed halls. Botanists are intrigued by how these flowers, typically found in the mystical groves of the Eldeen Reaches, have adapted to the urban environment of Sharn.

In the political landscape, this event has been largely met with passive interest. Some members of the [[Aurum]] have taken to decorating their estates with these glowing blossoms, viewing them as a status symbol. Meanwhile, [[House Vadalis]], bearers of the Mark of Handling and known for their expertise in flora and fauna, have expressed a desire to study these flowers further.

While the Starlight Blossoms' arrival is a minor event in the grand scheme of Sharn's bustling life, it serves as a gentle reminder of the world's enduring magic and mystery. As the city continues its daily hustle and bustle, the Starlight Blossoms glow quietly, adding a touch of serene beauty to the City of Towers.
