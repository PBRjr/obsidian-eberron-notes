Warforged are dead soldiers??
creation forges?
schematics in an ancient language? look draconic 
schematics of a metal heart, what is the purpose
why did they need a phylactery?

## Anonymous Letters


A minion of an overlord has been using the prophecy to send letters to Thora Tarkanan in hopes of starting a complete civil war within the city that will lead to total war throughout Khorvaire.

## Boromar Challenge Coin


## Description
This small coin appears to be made entirely of copper, when tested it is found to have a small magnetic property. 

On one side of the coin is a symbol representing a **silver dragon with folded wings perched on a tower**. On the other side is the [[Boromar clan|Boromar clan's]] motto:

> One need not be tall to stand atop the highest tower.

These coins are commonly used among Boromar operatives as a method of inter-agent authentication.

## Spy report 1
Subject: Mournland Activity
Date: 14 Eyre, 998YK 

Observation Report:

Marix's agents were seen entering the Mournland via the Dead-Gray Mist on three separate occasions. Locations marked on attached map. Attempts to follow have resulted in loss of contact with three operatives. 

No definitive connection between Mourning and weapons confirmed. Further investigation required, but advised caution.

End of report.

## Spy report 2
Subject: Weapon Production Methods
Date: 3 Nymm, 998YK

Observation Report:

Multiple shipments from the Mournland were tracked to Marix's facilities via lightning rale. Contents unknown, but believed to be related to Mourning weapons. Security is high.

An operative managed to infiltrate the premises but was discovered before gathering substantial information. Operative's last message mentioned something to do with "Captured Essence."

Further investigation is underway but has proven highly risky.

End of report.


## Incriminating Documents
To whom it may concern,

After careful consideration of the recent events and the opportunities they present, I have decided to move forward with the Mourn weapon production. Our connections within House Tarkanan shall remain discreet, and I assure you that our transactions will be conducted with the utmost secrecy.

The newly produced prototypes have proven quite functional. I am convinced that our collaboration will not only be profitable but also lead to significant advancements in arcane weaponry.

Best regards,

Marix d'Cannith


## Dragon Blood


> "Dragon's Blood is a magical phenomenon unlike any other. It enables the user to tap into a crude, unstable form of the primal forces of magic. But like handling raw elemental forces, the risks far outweigh the fleeting benefits. This drug not only wreaks havoc on the user's physical form but also destabilizes the very magical essence of their being. The uncontrolled magical outbursts are akin to trying to direct a thunderstorm with a tin roof - unpredictable, chaotic, and more often than not, disastrous."
<span class="right-align">-Illicit Magical Substance (IMS) researcher, Morgrave University</span>
---

Dragon Blood, also known as Blood or Heat, is an illegal substance commonly found in the lower levels of [[Sharn]]. In its raw form, it is a thick, iridescent liquid that shifts color in the light, reminiscent of an oil slick or a soap bubble. It is typically consumed by dropping the liquid onto the tongue, where it absorbs quickly into the bloodstream, causing an immediate and potent effect.

Users often describe the initial effects as a sensation of warmth spreading throughout the body, a quickening of the senses, and an unexplainable feeling of being deeply connected to the mystical weave of magic that permeates the world. Regular users become addicted, not just to the drug's effects but also to the feeling of power and the illusions of insight into the magical world around them.

However, the drug's long-term effects can be devastating. Prolonged use of Dragon's Blood results in physical deterioration and mental instability, as the body struggles to cope with the sudden influx of magical energy. It can lead to hallucinations, erratic behavior, and in the worst cases, wild magical outbursts.

---

The following is a table of random magical effects Dragon's Blood might trigger. The effects of each last for 1 minute, or 10 rounds, unless specified otherwise. 

1. The user emits a bright light in a 30-foot radius.
2. The next spell cast by the user targets a random creature within range, but does not use a spell slot. If the spell has an AOE, it is cast centered on a random creature in range.
3. The user vomits relentlessly, losing their next turn and gaining 1 point of exhaustion.
4. The user can only speak in haiku.
5. The user becomes enlarged, but gains a level of exhaustion once the effect wears off.
6. The user is under the effect of the invisibility spell for the duration.
7. The user gains a flying speed equal to their walking speed. If the user already has a flying speed, it doubles.
8. The user immediately casts Fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on themselves.
9. For the next minute, all the user's melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage, both to the target and the user.
10. The user is affected as if by the Polymorph spell, transformed into a sheep for the duration.

## Dragonshards


Dragonshards are fragments of the bodies of the progenitor dragons, and each type is associated with one of the dragons. These mystical stones have the ability to hold and channel magical energy, making them an integral part of many magical items and spells. They come in three types: Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron shards, each with unique characteristics and applications.

---

**Eberron Dragonshards**
Eberron shards, also known as "dragon's blood" (not to be confused with [[Dragon Blood]]) or bloodstones, are the most common type. They are typically found in rock formations or riverbeds across the world of Eberron. This shard's radiant, multicolored veins stand in stark contrast to its otherwise transparent exterior. Eberron shards are used to bind elemental creatures and power the mighty airships and lightning rails. They also play a vital role in the creation and operation of the Warforged and sentient constructs. ^90b643

---

**Siberys Dragonshards**
Siberys shards, or "dragon's tears", are the rarest and most coveted of the three. They are not found in the ground but instead fall from the Ring of Siberys that encircles the world. These shards are golden and exhibit a radiant glow. They are predominantly used for the creation of dragonmarks and serve as key components in the highest echelons of artifice. The Siberys shards are coveted by those with dragonmarks, as they can augment and enhance their powers. ^b906e5

---

**Khyber Dragonshards**
Khyber shards, known as "dragon's teeth", are found deep within the world, in the underdark and other subterranean locales. These shards have a sinister, dark hue, often perceived as an abyssal black or a deep blue. Khyber shards are used to create binding circles and magic items that contain or utilize fiends or other extraplanar entities. Their energy is considered potent but unpredictable, which often leads to their use in more nefarious magical applications. ^023b44

## Forge Knowledge Handout


**Does know**
- Warforged were made using the souls of fallen soldiers during the last war.
- Their creation involved trapping the soul in some kind of metal heart.
	- It looks like a small sphere with runes engraved on it, which subtly glowed with a golden-violet hue.
 - Forge was created in the first batch of modern warforged - and the only one that didn't lose his mind due to his new found form. All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.
 - All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead soldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.
 - In a battle during the last war, he sacrificed his and his men's lives in an explosion he set off to overtake the enemy. 
 - Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and infused into a warforged body. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.
 - Near the end of the war, he broke free and, using his skills from his past life, destroyed his creation forge.
	- He obtained information on his creation, including the methods that were still being used to create new warforged.
	- He threatened to go public with that [[forge knowledge handout|info]]. 
	- Knowing he would be unable to destroy all of the forges on his own, he forced House Cannith's hand into signing the Treaty of Thronehold and shutting down all creation forges, ending the production of new Warforged.
	- He didn't go public because in the back of his mind he knew one day he may want to "have children" or create new warforged in his name.
- When he was a human, Forge was blessed with a Mark of Making. As a warforged, his soul carried the mark to his new warforged body, which is now displayed as originating from his chest and creeping out to the rest of his body similarly to a system of veins and arteries that carry an ambient subtle glow who's color reflects his current mood.
- He is still being chased by agents of House Cannith to recover his blackmail and continue to study him.
- He has a note ripped out of an artificer's journal he found prior to destroying his creation forge.
- He was at The Lighthouse because he knew it contained a portal to Sharn.

### Artificer Journal Page Handout

---
The latest series of experiments aimed at recreating The Prototype has once again ended in failure. The primary challenge continues to be the integration of both Khyber and Siberys dragonshards into a single cohesive device.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Energetic Incompatibility:** When attempting to merge Khyber and Siberys dragonshards, the inherent properties of each shard result in violent energetic reactions. The Khyber shard's chaotic dark energy and the Siberys shard's radiant light energy create a destabilizing feedback loop, leading to catastrophic device failure.

3. **Material Fracture:** Even with the most refined binding agents and stabilization matrices, the structural integrity of the device cannot withstand the opposing forces of the shards. Repeated trials show that the casing fractures under the pressure, often shattering both the dragonshards and the housing materials.

3. **Arcane Conductivity Issues:** The arcane circuits designed to channel the combined energies of both shards are proving inadequate. The conduits either overload or burn out, unable to handle the simultaneous flow of both types of energy. This results in significant power loss and unpredictable surges.

**Current Adjustments & Theories:**
- **Single Shard Usage:** Given the repeated failures with dual-shard integration, we have temporarily shifted our focus to single shard implementations. Utilizing only a Khyber or Siberys shard simplifies the energy matrix, but this solution is incomplete and leads to noted psychosis in test subjects. The posthumous cooperation of fallen soldiers provides critical insights, yet their spirits are less stable under these conditions. Stabilization methods are in testing phase and are proving effective. 

- **Arcane Filtration:** We are exploring the potential of using arcane filters or buffers to mediate the energies of the two shards. The idea is to create a phased energy conduit that can sequentially manage the influx and outflux of each shard's energy rather than attempting simultaneous integration.

### Description

- A shattered [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber Dragonshard]] the size of a fist, covered in ancient draconic runes with a faint glow pulsing from within
- The gem is warm to the touch and has a gentle pulsing vibration.
- It has 4 visible chunks taken out of it, which clearly bore additional runes that are now missing.

### History

- As a part of the ancient ritual involving the sacrifice of the Couatl, Rak Tulkesh's avatar was separated from his demi planes, exposing a vulnerability. 
- Beaten by a force of ancient dragons, consciousness was sealed away in this Dragonshard.
- To keep it out of the hands of the [[Lords of Dust]], it was shattered, its fragments spread across the world.

### Powers/Abilities

- The Dragonshard contains the fragmented power of Rak Tulkesh.
- These shards are the sources of power [[Woe]] is seeking.
- They can be combined with a soul through a ritual, giving the user power, but also corrupting them.
- Once they are all combined again, the user's soul will be consumed as fuel to release Rak Tulkesh's avatar from its bonds.
- Can only be properly wielded by one that is *tainted*
	- One is tainted when they are born or die while in immediate proximity to the shard or its fragments
### Location

- The main gem is [[Woe#Abilities & Powers|Woe's phylactery]]
	- Lick: 1 Shard before airship crash
	- [[Professor Baelen ir'Torn]]: 1 Shard
	- 2 remaining shards: unknown

### Interacting With It

- Touching a shard gives the wielder a sense of unimaginable power that has been splintered and broken, as if the vastness of it is unreachable, just beyond the horizon.
- The shard can not be destroyed while a part of Rak Tulkesh's power remains within. It can only be fractured and contained.

### Hook
- The Silver Flame is constantly searching for it, even ransacking the Players quarters if they find out about it.
- [[Woe]] seeks to increase his power using the shards
- [[Mordakesh]] seeks to consume Woe's soul with the completed Dragonshard and unleash his master.

## Godlings, Demigods, and Other Mythical Creatures


#### Followers of Siberys and the Couatl

>Throughout history, numerous groups have devoted themselves to the worship of Siberys, the great dragon above, and the revered Couatl. These followers, including the Knights of the Silver Sky and the Order of the Eternal Dawn, have risen and fallen with time, each leaving a mark upon Eberron's history.
>
>Yet, none but one of these groups have endured since the legendary sacrifice of the Couatl. This one enduring group is believed to live secluded in the Byeshk Mountains, though this remains largely rumor, with no definitive evidence of their existence. Their name and true nature are lost to history, shrouded in mystery and legend.

## Jonston's Note


This piece of worn parchment has obviously seen the wear-and-tear of an active lifestyle. If Jon was killed it also has some blood smears on it.

> Dear Jonny,

## Legacy Stone


### Description:

- This shimmering Siberys Dragonshard is 2 inches long with the diameter of a grape. It has a rapid, darting glow, as though something is bouncing off the inner walls of the shard, trying to find an exit.
### Interacting With It:

- Once per long rest, when Geralt concentrates for at least 10 minutes while holding the Legacy Stone, he experiences a surge of warmth before his mind is flooded with a memory that is chosen at random from the table below.

***First Interaction***
>The Siberys dragonshard pulses warmly in your hand, its golden light seeping into your skin. For a moment, the workshop fades, replaced by a rush of sensations, emotions, and fragmented images. It’s not your memory, you realize, but hers. You are seeing the world through your mother's eyes, feeling the world through her body.

| 6   | The Rageblight       |         |

***Memory Descriptions***
**Kismet's Prophecy:** 
> The world shimmers, your senses flooded with the sights and smells of a crowded marketplace. You feel a small hand clutching yours as you and Norbit stand before a half-elf woman with striking eyes. She traces lines on your palm, her touch strangely warm. An unsettling feeling of knowing, of seeing threads of destiny intertwining, washes over you. She doesn't speak, but images flash through your mind – a towering city, a shattered land, a powerful artifact, a young boy facing a daunting task. A cold dread grips your heart.

**Norbit's Illness:**
> The air is heavy with the scent of parchment and ink. Lamplight flickers across a cluttered desk, illuminating diagrams and notes. You feel Norbit's hand trembling in yours as he coughs, a rattling sound that echoes in the silence. A wave of nausea washes over you, not from the illness, but from the crushing realization that time is slipping away. You glance at a drawing of a complex device, its intricate workings promising a solution, a chance to cheat fate.

**Sibernyan Discovery:**
>Wind howls outside, rattling the shutters of a small, isolated cabin perched atop a snow-covered mountain. Inside, a fire crackles in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on rough-hewn walls. You feel a mixture of anticipation and unease as you sit across a table from a figure shrouded in a thick cloak, his face obscured by the shadows. As he speaks, his voice is a low, melodic rumble, unlike any language you've ever heard. You sense an ancient wisdom, a connection to something beyond mortal comprehension. Norbit leans forward, his brow furrowed in concentration as he grasps the strange words, responding in kind.

**Steelhardt Prototype:** 
>The air vibrates with energy, tingling your skin. A faint humming sound fills the chamber as you and Norbit stand before a pulsing device. You feel a surge of triumph as you complete the final connection, the culmination of years of research. A brilliant light flares, momentarily blinding you, then fades, leaving behind a sense of awe and a lingering taste of ozone. A deep, primal fear whispers within you, a warning about the choices you've made, about the forces you've put into motion. You've done what no one else could, you've conquered a primal force of nature with nothing but your minds. You should be relieved. And yet, you can't shake the feeling that you just changed the course of the world in more ways than you can imagine. 

**House Cannith Escape:**
>Rain lashes your face, cold and relentless. Your heart pounds in your chest as you and Norbit race through the dark, winding alleys, a crying young boy clutched in your arms. You feel the presence of pursuers, their footsteps echoing on the cobblestones. You turn a corner, praying you lost them. Norbit squeezes your shoulder as you calm the boy whose head is nuzzling into your shirt. Terror grips you, fueled by the knowledge that you're not just protecting yourselves, but something far more precious, something that could change the world.

**The Rageblight**
> Three inch thick glass encased by cold steel is all that separates yourself and Norbit from... him. He's strapped to an exam table by concrete reinforced bindings that stress and crack as he strains against them. Dark red veins spider-web across his skin, which looks as though its been stretched across his body, as though any more tension would cause it to rip and tear in places. A large scar runs down the middle of his chest, inflamed and irritated. His eyes are jet black. "I don't know why this happened," you say aloud, "Our math checked out. The components were good. There's got to be something we're missing." Norbit starts a reply, but its interrupted with a cough from his lungs and a splatter of blood in his palm. Marix talks over him, his eyes fixed on the creature in the other room, "This is what happens if we get this wrong. He was one of my best before he volunteered. Now... I don't think there's anything left of him inside." The thing on the other side of the glass began to scream and strain against his bindings. The one holding his left arm splinters and shatters. He reaches over to start destroying his other bindings, but then a blue gas vents into the room, and he calms. "Now he's just a mistake... and an example. Don't get it wrong again."
### Location:

- Behind an impenetrable locked door in [[Wolfsbane Workshop]]

### Ownership/Affiliation: 

- House Cannith has been trying to get behind the locked door since Geralt's parents fled House Cannith.

### Significance: 

- Contained within are flashbacks to important memories in Yelena's life, from her perspective. They were planted in this stone by his parents for Geralt to find.

## When the Couatl Sing


**Original Text:**

_"Yndri'a szaran, ilsha'ar,  
Siberys thraka, il'sharak.  
Couatl vraka, il'shandor,  
Tir'kiva vara, draka'nor._

_Vor'sha elara, siba'ryn,  
Sha'thrak, Couatl'yn.  
Tirak rasha, varaa'sh,  
Siberys il'a, ven'rash."_

---

**Translation:**

_"In the light of dawn, the sky,  
Siberys rises, the great dragon.  
Couatl speak, with strength and wisdom,  
Guardians of peace and truth._

_Hold the ideals, followers of Siberys(underlined),  
Power and grace, the way of the Couatl.  
Their voices bring justice,  
Siberys' will, guiding the world."_
