**Bjorn's Reading:**
> The storm you carry has not lessened, has it, son of the mountains? It now rages with the echoes of a fallen kingdom and the cries of a desperate mother. You seek to reclaim a home that is no longer yours, to fight a brother who is no longer himself. Be wary, for the path back is not paved with stone, but with the shards of a terrible legacy. The flame you were forged in may be the only thing that can cauterize the wound... or burn everything you love to ash.

**Draven's Reading:**
> The Knight of the North wears a familiar face, but the soul behind it is a stranger. You've gathered the pieces of your name, but the picture they form is still shattered. The light you once followed has been stolen, wielded now by the very darkness you were sworn to fight. You search for memories, but perhaps you should be searching for truth. What is a knight without his oath? And what becomes of an oath when its purpose is a lie?

**Geralt's Reading:**
> The wolf cub who sought answers now carries them within his very being. A mother's love, a mother's knowledge... a mother's curse. The heart of stone beats with a borrowed life, ticking like a clock towards a terrible choice. You run from one death only to race towards another. The path to the mountain peak is clear, but the man who reaches it may not be the same one who started the climb.

**Forge's Reading:**
> A mind of flesh in a body of steel. You carry the weight of a war you ended and the ghosts of the men you sacrificed. You seek to understand your creation, but do you understand what you have become? A father without children, a soldier without a war. But a new war is coming, and a ghost from your past now wears the face of the enemy. Be careful, lest the very thing you fight to prevent—the creation of more like you—becomes your only salvation.

**Lox's Reading:**
> You carry a fire fueled by righteous grief, a power granted to avenge a stolen future. But the hand that feeds your flame is cloaked in shadow, and the path to your revenge is paved with deception. You hunt a murderer, but you are blind to the true monster. The favor you owe will come due, and you will learn that the price for power is not paid in gold, but in what you value most. Are you sure you know what that is?

**Nyx's Reading:**
> The forest weeps with you, mother of a lost child. You see her in the corner of your eye, a memory, a ghost, a warning. Do you trust your sight? Or do you trust your grief? A great deception holds your family in its grasp, and the cure is not in vengeance, but in vision. Look past the veil of what you *believe* to be true, and see the truth that *is*. The child is not gone, merely... misplaced. And the choice her father must make will determine if she is lost forever.
