**Bjorn's Reading:**
> The storm you carry has not lessened, has it, son of the mountains? It now rages with the echoes of a fallen clan and the cries of a desperate mother. You seek to reclaim a home that is no longer yours, to fight a brother who is no longer himself. Be wary, for the path back is paved not with stone, but with the fragments of two shattered legacies. You must re-forge the pieces of one to cleanse the other.

**Draven's Reading:**
> The Knight of the North wears a familiar face, but the soul behind it is a stranger. You've gathered the pieces of your name, but the picture they form is still shattered. The light you once followed has been stolen, wielded now by the very darkness you were sworn to fight. You search within yourself for clues of your forgotten oath, shuffling around memories like puzzle pieces. Perhaps its time you turn outward. Perhaps instead of looking for your lost oath, you should look for the creature that you swore it to.

**Geralt's Reading:**
> The wolf cub who sought answers now carries them within his very being. A mother's love, a mother's knowledge... a mother's curse. The heart of stone beats with a borrowed life, ticking like a clock towards a certain fate. You run from one death only to race towards another. The path to the mountain peak is clear, but the man who reaches it may not be the same one who started the climb. The journey in between is where you will decide who Geralt Wolfsbane really is.

**Forge's Reading:**
> A mind of flesh in a body of steel. You carry the weight of a war you ended and the ghosts of the men you sacrificed. You seek to understand your rebirth before considering the death that brought you there. And now look what you've become. A father without children, a soldier without a war. But a new war is coming, and a ghost from your past now wears the face of the enemy. But be warned, metal man, that in the absence of self awareness, the enemies face may one day look like the one that stares back at you in the mirror.

**Lox's Reading:**
> You carry a power fueled by righteous grief, a power granted to avenge a stolen future. But the hand that feeds your rage is cloaked in shadow, and the path to your revenge is paved with deception. You hunt a murderer, but you are blind to the true monster. The favor you owe will come due, and you will learn that the price for power is not paid in gold, but in what you value most. In time, you will decide if that is a price worth paying.

**Nyx's Reading:**
> You mourn a theft of something most pure, and you hear the forest join you in anguish. But the daughter you lost answered a song only she could hear. Your husband's path of righteous vengeance is a gilded cage, and with every step he takes, the bars grow stronger. The fire of his grief is the very heat that forges the key. Be wary, mother, for the debt he must pay will come from you both, and the lock he turns will not open a door to her return, but to His.
