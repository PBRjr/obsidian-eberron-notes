### Background

Consider the intertwining plot elements such as the Boromar Clan's activities and the Red Cloak Battalion's actions. Given the existing sessions, the readings should subtly reflect these narrative threads, creating an anticipation for future events and decisions.

### Session 12 Focus

Ensure that Kismet's readings connect with the overarching themes of the campaign, such as moral ambiguity and destiny. Each reading should provide not just foresight but also challenge the characters to decide between divergent paths.

Engage the players by leaving space for them to interpret their destinies. Use these readings to plant seeds for future story hooks and personal quests that can unfold as the campaign progresses.
