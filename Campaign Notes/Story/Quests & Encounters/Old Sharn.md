brainstorming:
they land in the water surrounded by debris and fresh corpses

once they get their bearings, some large and grotesque creature stomps in
the creature is blind but has better hearing. It will charge anything that it hears that might be a creature
this charge can create new openings

What is the creature? Specific mechanics?

ways the party may escape Old sharn
elevator to surface towers
OR follow flowing water on a boat that narrows and turns into sewers.

SEWERS - encounter with a gelatinous cube? maybe sewer gators? other things?
