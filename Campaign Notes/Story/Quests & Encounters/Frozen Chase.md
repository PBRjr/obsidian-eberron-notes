Here is a detailed breakdown for the **House Cannith Interception** encounter.

This is designed as a **Multi-Stage Boss Encounter** where the "Boss" is the vehicle itself and the crew it deploys.

# Encounter: The Frost-Bound Interceptor

**Faction:** House Cannith
**Objective:** Capture **Forge** and retrieve the **Steelhardt** (carried by Lox).
**Enemy Vessel:** *The Iron Falcon* (Cannith Fast-Attack Airskiff).
**Commander:** Artificer Verrick (speaking through amplified speakers).

## The Gimmick: "The Elemental Freeze"
The extreme cold of the Icehorn Mountains is messing with the airship's propulsion ring (a Fire Elemental bound in a containment ring).
*   **The Mechanic:** At the start of each Round, the Airship rolls a **d20**.
    *   **1-5 (System Shock):** The elemental flickers. The ship loses altitude or weapons malfunction (Player's advantage).
    *   **Targeting Weaknesses:** Players can target the **Thermal Vents** on the ship (AC 16). Dealing 15+ damage to a vent forces the ship to automatically fail its next System Shock roll as the engine freezes.

## Variant A: The High-Speed Chase (On Bikes)
*Use this if the party flees the Nameless Town on the Red Hands' motorcycles.*

**Mechanic:** Relative Position. The fight takes place in 3 "Lanes" (Left, Center, Right). The Airship flies above, matching speed.

### Stage 1: Aerial Harassment (100% - 75% Ship HP)
The ship flies high, dropping hazards.
*   **Action:** *Magma Droppers.* The ship drops alchemist fire bombs in front of the bikes.
    *   **Save:** DEX Save (DC 14) or the bike takes damage and the rider takes fire damage.
*   **Troops:** Two **"Skystrikers"** (Warforged with gliders) detach. They try to land *on* the bikes to grapple the drivers.
    *   *Goal:* Slow the PCs down so the ship can use its grappling magnet.

### Stage 2: The Magnet & The Freeze (75% - 25% Ship HP)
The cold begins to affect the ship. It drops lower to try and end this quickly.
*   **Action:** *The Arcane Magnet.* The ship targets the bike carrying **Lox** (Steelhardt) or **Forge**.
    *   **Save:** STR Save (DC 15). On a fail, the bike is lifted 10 ft into the air. The rider must sever the magnetic tether (Attack AC 14) or be pulled into the ship's holding bay.
*   **Troops:** The ship opens its side bay doors. Crossbowmen fire from cover.
*   **Opportunity:** The **Thermal Vents** are now visible and targetable.

### Stage 3: Crash Landing (25% - 0% Ship HP)
The elemental ring freezes over. The ship loses control.
*   **Event:** The ship crashes into the snow *ahead* of the party, blocking the pass.
*   **Climax:** The surviving crew (Verrick and 2 Elite Guards) crawl out of the wreckage for one final stand to delay the party while the ship's self-destruct sequence (a wailing siren) counts down.

---

## Variant B: The Stand-Off (On Foot)
*Use this if the terrain becomes too rough for bikes, or the bikes freeze/break down.*

**Map Layout:** An open tundra field with scattered rocks for cover. The Airship hovers overhead.

### Stage 1: Strafing Runs (100% - 60% Ship HP)
The ship circles the battlefield, too high for melee, requiring ranged attacks or magic.
*   **Action:** *Lightning Turrets.* The ship fires two beams of lightning at players not in cover.
*   **Troops:** The ship drops 4 **Cannith Troopers** via rappel lines. They engage the party on the ground to flush them out of cover.
*   **Player Goal:** Survive the troops and shoot the ship's hull/weapons.

### Stage 2: Deployment (60% - 20% Ship HP)
The cold forces the ship to hover only 15ft off the ground to conserve heat.
*   **Action:** *Vent Purge.* The ship blasts superheated steam in a 15ft cone under it. (Dex Save DC 14).
*   **Troops:** The ramp lowers. A **"Cannith Iron-Mauler"** (a beefy, ogre-sized Warforged designed for heavy lifting) jumps out.
*   **Player Goal:** The ramp is open. Players can try to *board* the ship to attack the engine core directly, or destroy the Iron-Mauler.

### Stage 3: Critical Failure (20% - 0% Ship HP)
The propulsion ring shatters from the cold.
*   **Event:** The ship slams into the ground, becoming a piece of terrain.
*   **Hazard:** The elemental breaks loose. A **Fire Elemental** (confused and raging) spawns from the wreckage and attacks *everyone* (Cannith and Party alike).
*   **Win Condition:** Defeat the Elemental and the remaining crew.

## Stat Block Shortcuts

**The Iron Falcon (Airship)**
*   **AC:** 16 (Hull), 14 (Glacial-crusted Wings)
*   **HP:** 200 (Use "Threshold" damage: damage under 10 is ignored to simulate heavy armor, unless it's Thunder or Acid).
*   **Weakness:** Fire damage heals the engine (fixes the cold), Cold damage forces a System Shock roll immediately.

**Cannith Skystriker (Minion)**
*   *Use Scout stats, but add:*
*   **Glide:** Can move 60ft when falling.
*   **Magnetic Boots:** Advantage against being shoved.

**Artificer Verrick**
*   *Use Mage stats, but swap spells for:* *Heat Metal, Shatter, Shield, Magic Missile (Wand).*
*   *Loot:* He carries a **Keycard** (useful for later Cannith encounters) and a **Prototype Heating Orb** (Common magic item, keeps user warm in extreme cold).
