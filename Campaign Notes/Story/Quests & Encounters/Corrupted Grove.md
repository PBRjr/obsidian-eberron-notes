- **Objective:** Neutralize or remove the dragonshard to cleanse the grove, possibly through combat with guardians, a ritual, or solving a puzzle related to [[Woe]]'s magic.
- **Location:** Once-sacred grove, now dying from a dark Khyber dragonshard's influence.
- **Description:** Trees and plants are twisted, withering with a purple tinge. A large, pulsing Khyber dragonshard corrupts the grove, radiating dark energy.
- **Guardians:** Mutated creatures or corrupted plant life, transformed by the shard's power.
- **Atmosphere:** Thick with malevolence, the air glows faintly purple from the shard's light, casting an unsettling pall over the area.
