**Battle Map Brainstorm**
- **Tier 1: The Entry (Bottom):** A wide, snow-covered plateau where the players enter. Deep snow (Difficult Terrain).
- **Tier 2: The Anvil (Middle - 10ft up):** A slick sheet of ice connecting the bottom and top tiers. This is a choke point. The **Shard-Bound Elementals** start here to block the path.
- **Tier 3: The Throne (Top - 20ft up):** A jagged overlook where Hrothgar starts. It has pillars of ice for cover.
