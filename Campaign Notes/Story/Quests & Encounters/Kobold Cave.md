## Encounters
### Dialogue between 2 kobolds
**Nasally Kobold**: "Hey, did you see Brains? He all twitchy and scribbling again."

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Yeah, he mad 'bout the last bunch. Not right for the big wake-up thing. He say Woe trick us."

**Nasally Kobold**: "He keep saying 'need willing ones.' What that mean? We just grab what Woe give, right?"

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Shh! Don't let Brains hear ya. He think he big thinker, say he got plan. But some say he not know anything."

**Nasally Kobold**: "Bah, just want big fire and boom like in prophecy. Brains better be right, or maybe we find new boss, huh?"
### Brain's mutterances
- "No, no, no... not right, not right. Woe said willing... where find willing? Stupid, stupid!"
- "Prophecy say... blood of willing. But these not willing. Why not work? Brains think, think... must be answer."
- "Others whisper, whisper behind Brains. They think Brains not know... but Brains smartest! Must show them, must prove!"
- "If not get right one, all bad. All bad for Brains. Others get angry, maybe want new leader. No, no, can't let that happen."
## Enemy goals
- Want to summon [[Argonnessen#Secrets|The Daughter of Khyber]] by doing a ritual sacrifice of a "*Willing Dragon Kin*".
	- They misinterpreted this as any Dragonborn/Kobolds, not a willing dragon that has to sacrifice itself.
- This sacrifice is a mistaken ancient take on a part of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] that states if a willing dragon kin is sacrificed in a very particular set of circumstances, The Daughter of Khyber will be freed.

### Prophecy Fragment concerning Tiamat
> In the hour when shadows grow long and the moon bleeds its light, the Daughter of Khyber shall stir in her dark slumber. Only then, if the kin of dragons, willing in heart and spirit, offers itself unto the void, shall the chains of the Daughter weaken. Her roar shall echo through the Five Sorrows, and the world shall tremble before her awakening.
