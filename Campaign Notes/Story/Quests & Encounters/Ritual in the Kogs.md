Location: [[Kogs Ritual Chamber]]

**Ritual Completion and Dismissal by Mordakhesh**:

- As the ritual concludes, the air thick with arcane energy, Mordakhesh steps back from the altar. He observes Woe, who is still recovering from the procedure. With a slight tone of concern mixed with command, Mordakhesh advises, "Rest now, let the shard’s essence meld with your own. But first, dispose of our uninvited guests." This comment is made dismissively, without even a glance at the party, underscoring their perceived insignificance.

**Woe's Awakening**:

- Woe lethargically sits up, his eyes flashing with newly imbued purple energy. He lazily stretches a hand towards a dormant piece of machinery nearby. As his fingers twitch, a burst of purple energy flows from his hand into the machine, which whirs to life, its mechanical eyes glowing with the same ominous purple.
- He watches with mild interest, a slight smirk on his face, as the machine turns towards the party, ready to attack.

**Combat Dynamics**:

- The enchanted machine, powered by the dragonshard’s essence, aggressively targets the party. Describe the machine’s movements as unnaturally swift and powerful, enhanced by the magical energy.
- Throughout the fight, as the party manages to damage the machine, Woe, with minimal effort, could casually redirect his energy to enchant other machinery in the room to join the fray, each time causing the cavern to rumble ominously.

**Environmental Collapse and Escape Routes**:

- The ongoing battle and the unstable arcane energy cause the cavern to shake violently. Debris falls, blocking the path they originally took while conveniently opening up another route that leads deeper into the maze of the Kogs and possibly exits near an unexpected part of Sharn.
- As the party battles or decides to flee, they notice the structural integrity of the cavern degrading, hinting that staying much longer could be fatal.

**The Magic’s Limit and Woe's Disinterest**:

- If the party manages to distance themselves from the animated machinery, perhaps through clever maneuvering or by making a dash for the new escape route, they'll notice the purple energy begins to fade from the machines, causing them to slow and eventually stop, unable to pursue further.
- Woe assumes the machines have dealt with the party or that they are no longer his problem. He dismisses them from his mind and exits via his own means, perhaps a portal or cloaked in a shroud of shadows, to recover from the ritual’s exertions.

### Conclusion and Aftermath:

- Once safe, the party can regroup and process the sheer power and threat Woe represents. This encounter not only sets up Woe as a formidable foe but also deepens the mystery and danger of what he and Mordakhesh are planning.
- This experience can lead to new objectives, such as finding ways to counteract or dismantle the dragonshard’s influence, or investigating other areas of Sharn that might hold the key to stopping Woe’s machinations.
