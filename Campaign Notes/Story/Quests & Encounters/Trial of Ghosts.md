The party must use the information they gather from [[The Nameless Town at the Base of the Mountain]] to heal Varyn.

**The Setting:** Inside the cabin, it is uncomfortably warm, yet Varyn (the frail old man) is shivering. He is muttering to an empty chair, apologizing to people who aren’t there. When the party enters, he doesn't seem surprised; he looks resigned. His eyes are glazed a milky-white.

**The Delusion:**  
Varyn believes the party are **Spirits of Condemnation** sent by the Silver Flame to judge him before he dies.

- He sees **Draven** as "The Failure of Power" (A weapon he broke).
- He sees **Bjorn** as "The Failure of Loyalty" (The son of the friend he abandoned).
- He sees **Forge** as an impossibility/hallucination of the Balance he never achieved.

**The Mechanic:** The party must accumulate **3 Successes**.

- **Failures:** Varyn retreats further into his mind, dealing 5d6 - 10d6 psychic damage to the party as the cabin shakes with uncontrolled Couatl magic.

### Step 1: Confronting the "Failure of Loyalty" (Bjorn)

Varyn looks at Bjorn and refuses to make eye contact.

> **Varyn:** _"I see you, son of the Wolf. You wear your father's face to mock me. I promised Kvitrafn I would watch the mountain, but I let the shadow take your brother. Go away, ghost. There is no redemption here."_


### Step 2: Confronting the "Failure of Power" (Draven)

Varyn looks at Draven with heartbreak. This is the hardest for him.

> **Varyn:** _"And you... the cruelest trick. I stitched your meat back together, but I couldn't call the light back. You are just a walking wound, a hollow shell wearing the armor of a hero I killed. Why do you torment me?"_

Mentioning the hymn from the nameless town auto-clears this step

### Step 3: Confronting the "Failure of Legacy" (Geralt/Forge/Lox)

Varyn looks at the others, specifically drawn to the strangeness of Forge or the intellect of Geralt.

> **Varyn:** _"And the rest... specters of a world I let burn. The darkness has won, hasn't it? The Draconic Prophecy has unraveled. There is no point in fighting anymore."_


### Success

If the party succeeds, the air in the cabin shifts. The oppressive heat vanishes, replaced by a clean, cold mountain breeze.

Varyn blinks, his eyes changing from milky white to a piercing, serpentine gold for a split second before returning to human eyes. He looks at Draven, truly seeing him.

> **Varyn:** _"You... you are warm. You are stubborn. By the Flame... you're actually here."_  
> _(He grips Draven’s arm with surprising strength for an old man)_  
> _"I thought I left you empty. But I see it now. The vessel didn't shatter... it just needed time to cure."_
