## Airship Crash

In the middle of the night the airship is attacked by Woe, a Warforged Lieutenant to [[Mordakesh]], who on the hunt for a fragment of the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard to increase his power, which is fueled by such fragments.

The ship will crash just south of Drum Keep. Captain Marsh's home is a half-day travel west in Shavalant

## Woe & Team
The attacking party consist of 1  and 6 [[Statblocks#Pteranodon|Pteranodons]], with 2 [[Statblocks#Kobold|Kobolds]] riding each except for one, which is ridden by the Kobold Scale sorcerer. 

The attacking 'bandits' will target the strongest people first. Their objective is to bring the ship down. Eventually, Woe will fly in, held aloft by magic, and drop a fireball directly on the Khyber Dragonshard holding the elemental, bringing the ship down in a heap of fire and splinters.

## After the crash
- The crash site is in a forest clearing, with debris and wreckage scattered around. Bodies of crew members and passengers are strewn about.
- Woe is seen tearing taunting Lick, then killing him with swift efficiency and taking his necklace.
- Woe flies off after securing what he was after, leaving the Kobolds to do as they wish.
- There are several kobold warriors scavenging the wreckage for valuables. They are opportunistic and will attack the PCs on sight.
- After 2 encounters, they come to a narrowing in the river where they can spot Captain Marsh being beaten by laughing kobolds.
- Across the river is the sorcerer leader and his remaining 2 Pteranodon riders, holding the captain captive and beating him. They don't notice the PCs initially, but if they aren't stopped quickly they will kill the captain.
