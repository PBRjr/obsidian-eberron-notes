#### PC: Geralt Wolfsbane
- Yelena & Norbit Wolfsbane
	- Geralt's mother and father
	- Wolfsbane is Norbit's family name
	- They both adopted the d'Cannith name, then later gave it up after they left the house.
- Parents died when he was young
	- Killed by Vorak (prior to transformation) as ordered by Marix d'Cannith.
- Geralt's parents originally created the first designs of the Steelhardt while they were a part of House Cannith
	- It was originally intended to be a way of transferring one's "soul" to a new body, effectively producing immortality.
		- The consciousness was attached to the Steelhardt in a magical ritual
		- It then had to be implanted into a corpse for the consciousness to then take over.
		- They created one prototype, combining a Khyber & Siberys shard in the device
		- It was fully functional as intended, but they never wrote down how they got those two shards to work together.
		- Cannith Artificer's subsequent attempts to combine the shards in new designs always failed.
	- They worked for years refining the designs.
	- Marix, working with the LoD, took an interest in these designs for use in creating a sentient warforged army.
		- Yelena and Norbit found out about Marix's plans and fled House Cannith with all of the designs, hiding with their young son near the Whitehorn Woods.
- Geralt was snooping in his father's office when he found the designs laid out across his desk.
		- Being unable to read them, he stole a page that had 'cool' designs and runes on it, also bearing the Gorgon seal of House Cannith.
		- He still has this page to this day.
		- A part of why he has learnt so many languages was to decode this page, but he was never able to.
			- It is written in an ancient language that his parents spoke, due to their inherent secrecy (**Sibernyan**)
			- Language was prominently spoken by the Couatl.
- One night his parents were murdered in their home by Vorak, who stole the prototype schematics. 
- When his parents were killed, he escaped and fled into the woods. He was about 12. He learned to live off the land and was able to survive.
- He now lives near Shavalant and the Whitehorn Woods.

#### PC: Forge
- ***Secret Warforged Lore:***
	- Warforged are the man-made reincarnates of the fallen soldiers in the Last War; Their souls were repurposed as weapons in the war that took their lives once already.
	- The first few batches of Warforged were created without a 'soul' - mindless automatons that had no self initiative or instinct. They were grunts, they followed orders, but on average they were less effective than a typical soldier.
	- Cannith artificers devised a method of transferring the soul of a recently deceased humanoid into the body of a warforged - building on the original *Steelhardt* designs taken from Geralt's parents.
	- Forge was the first of these new warforged - and the only one that didn't lose his mind due to his new found form. All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated after the creation process. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.
		- The missing traits being: The soul being transferred MUST have aspects of Khyber & aspects of Siberys fused to the soul to transfer without sanity loss.
		- Forge's Steelhardt used Siberys shards as a conduit. In all other warforged in his batch, only having a Siberys shard wasn't enough, since there was no aspect of Khyber attached to their soul/in the Steelhardt.
		- Hence why Vorak's transfer was tainted as well. His Steelhardt used a Khyber shard conduit, but there was no aspect of Siberys in him.
		- Since Forge died in proximity to Lick's father's FKD fragment, an aspect of Khyber attached to his soul, which, in addition to the Siberys Dragonshard conduit in his Steelhardt, meant he retained his memories AND his sanity.
		- This information about the missing traits is not currently known **(Vorak stole most of the schematics, which were scattered in various locations for furture quests)
	- All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead sldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.
- Human General of **House Cannith (Or maybe some other affiliation makes more sense?)**
- In a **battle during the last war (The same battle Woe died to Lick's father in?)**, he sacrificed himself for his men and lost his life in an **explosion I set off to overtake the enemy**
	- Woe and Forge were fighting for the same side? Forge valued winning the battle/war over the lives of his own men. While Woe and Lick's father were engaged in battle, Forge made the decision to sacrifice himself and his entire squad to blow up and destroy the **target (what was the target/what was this battle being fought for?)**.
	- Woe died close to Lick's father's fragment of the *FKD*, causing a dark cancer to latch onto his soul which allowed him to be resurrected into a Warforged body through Mordakhesh's ritual (more details in Woe's backstory)
- Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and **infused into a Warforged body (Forge had signed up for this secret program through House Cannith? Or was he chosen without his consent? Why?)**. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.
- Near the end of the war, he broke free and, using his skills from his past life, **destroyed his creation forge**.
	- He obtained information on his creation, including the methods that were still being used to create new warforged.
	- **He threatened to go public with that [[forge knowledge handout|info]]? (Knowing he would be unable to destroy all of the forges on his own, he forced House Cannith's hand into signing the Treaty of Thronehold and shutting down all creation forges, ending the production of new Warforged?)(Maybe he didn't go public because in the back of his mind he knew one day he may want to "have children"? See 'character motivation'.** 
- Warforged were not liberated due to the Treaty of Thronehold. This treaty was a political move so that Forge would not go public with the information he holds on Warforged production and ruin House Cannith's reputation.
- Due to the ever-looming threat of blackmail, House Cannith has been hunting Forge ever since his escape, attempting to **capture him for further study (probably to continue to attempt to replicate the traits that allowed him to keep his memories)** and eliminate the possibility of that information ever getting out.
- A unique **Dragonmark (dragonmark found on the designs of the Steelhardt? It started small but has continued growing on his body due to his unique creation process?)** sprouted from his chest shortly after his creation, and has slowly continued to grow to different parts of his body **(Could the unique dragonmark somehow tie him to Geralt's parents designs? Perhaps they secretly hid a 'calling card' or watermark that would clue people into their designs being used?)**
- He learned of **another creation forge (In sharn? How did he find out?)**, explaining his presence outside the lighthouse during his introduction to the campaign in session 5.
- ***Character motivation:***
	- Is it unethical to create more in my image? Does that make me a God, or does that make me one of you?
#### PC: Sylas Stormshadow (Deceased)
- Father was an Elven scholar focused on forbidden knowledge about magic
- Mother was a human merchant in Sharn's Underbelly
- Learned of eldritch power through his father
- Made a pact w/ the Traveler in the sewers
- Would be randomly taken to a different plane for the Traveler's duties
## Story Plot Pieces
- **Themes**:
	- What makes a person good? 
	- Most villains aren't purely evil, but have their own justifications.
	- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?
	- If one has only known evil since birth, are they redeemable or can they overcome that nature? 

- **Central Tension**: The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh
	- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. 
		- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed
		- The silver flame caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so
		- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world

- **Significant NPCs**
	- Varyn "The Valiant" Grayburn
		- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl
		- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame
		- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons
			- Directly oppose actions of the Lords of Dust
			- A small group within felt that Clan Flameforge's scope was too narrow.
			- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.
		- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.
			- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.
			- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.
			- The LoD found out and also began a search.
			- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.
			- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.
		- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.
		- He saw the purity and potential within Draven
			- The darkness within the shard never affected him.
		- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:
			- The White Flameblade
			- The dragonshard fragment
		- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber

	- Aeren d'Cannith
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To discover the extent of House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning
		- Was adopted into House Cannith about 20 years ago at the age of 18 y/o as the Youngest Master Artificer (and only Master Artificer without a Mark of Creation) ever named within the house.
			- Due to his invention of the ingenious Everbright Lantern
		- He is now the Mentor to Miri, the magewright currently living in Shavelant.
		- Aeren knew Geralt's parents for a short time when he was adopted into the House.
		- He does not know what Geralt's schematics say, but he knows that they are written in Sibernyan
		- He knows House Cannith had something to do with the Day of Mourning, and is trying to find out more. (needs development: why does he know something is up?)

**Artifacts**
- Artifact 1: ***Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD) & Fragments***
	- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.
		- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of their location, and have been hunting them down since.
		- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.
	- Contains imprisoned essence of Rak Tulkesh
	- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted
	- Who has them
		- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment (taken from Lick in session 1)
		- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment (Needs development, where/how did he find it?)
		- Hrothgar: 1 fragment, obtained from Draven when Hrothgar battled and killed him

- Artifact 2: ***Etherseraph***
	- The Etherseraph was crafted by Varyn following the Silver Flame's creation.
	- In addition to a powerful weapon, the Etherseraph is a tool:
		- The white flame of the Etherseraph will clear the fog of the Mourning and light the way to the Gate of the Silver Flame.
		- The Gate is the entrance to the pocket dimension that contains the actual Silver Flame.
	- Over the years, Varyn has gifted it to many people he deemed worthy to carry it, the most notable being Tira Miron, who, years ago, used it to reseal an escaped Overlord and become the Voice of the Silver Flame.
	- Draven Flameforge was another that was trained by Varyn, and gifted the Etherseraph to wield in the name of Siberys.
	- It is now in Hrothgar's possession, obtained when he killed Draven in battle.

- Artifact 3: ***Steelhardt***
	- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.
	- Geralt's parent knew that the transference would only be successful if balance between all 3 *Aspects of the Progenitors* were maintained.
		- **Siberys's aspect:** Light, Divinity
		- **Khyber's aspect:** Darkness, Impiety
		- **Eberron's aspect:** Materialism, Tangibility
	- Any imbalance of these 3 (like only using a Khyber/Siberys shard without the other) would result in an imbalance of the soul, causing psychosis.
	- Yelena and Norbit created a single prototype that worked fully as intended. They combined Siberys and Khyber dragonshards into the device, which allowed those two aspects to be fullfu
	- The LoD seek to use a Steelhardt to transfer Rak Tulkesh's essence from the FKD into a living avatar, so that he could be freed from his bonds and reign over Eberron once again (See Woe's plot pieces).

- **Villains**
	- Vorak
		- Vorak was House Cannith's most skilled assassin, loyal to the House for most of his life. Originally a half-elf, he served for over a hundred years until his age forced him out of field work, though he remained a top advisor for covert activities within the House.
		- He was sent by Marix d'Clone to kill Geralt's parents after they fled House Cannith.
		- Voluntarily underwent House Cannith's very first attempt at using the Steelhardt to transfer a soul to another body.
		- The transfer was successful, moving Vorak from his original body to a younger, stronger one from a random deceased soldier.
		- While he retained his memories, his mind quickly became plagued with dark thoughts, his grip on reality worsening.
		- He went rogue, and was manipulated by Mordakhesh, who focused Vorak's mind to one objective: destory the Silver Flame.
		- Bolstered by new dark powers infused into his Steelhardt by Mordakesh, he led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.
			- His attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, turning him into a rage-fueled creature of destruction, and allowing the Silver Flame to defend itself by causing the Mourning.
		- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, feeding off the rage of the survivors, and using it to resurrect himself should he fall in battle.
		- His darkness-infused Steelhardt causes him to achieve quasi-lichdom through unique means:
			- Should his body ever die, his soul will be kept safe in his Steelhardt until it is placed into a new body.
			- The survivors of his onslaughts get the unrelenting urge to find Vorak and kill him, but if Vorak is dead they find the Steelhardt instead.
			- Once one of the survivors finds his Steehardt, rage consumes them, and forces them to plunge the artifact into their own chest, killing them, and allowing Vorak to resurrect through their body.
			- This process can only be stopped through a ritual involving a Siberys Dragonshard

	- Woe
		- Was originally a human soldier fighting in the Last war under his commanding officer, Forge.
		- During a battle, he was locked into a duel with Lick's father, who wore a fragment of the *FKD* around his neck.
		- During this duel, Forge set off an explosion that completed their objective, but also killed Forge, Woe, Lick's father, and most others that were involved in this battle.
		- Woe's proximity to the fragment of the *FKD* during his death caused his soul to be tainted, keeping him in 'Limbo' after death.
		- Mordakhesh - led by the Draconic Prophecy - resurrected Woe in a profane ritual that stored his soul into the *FKD*, fusing it with the essence of Rak Tulkesh, and containing it in a Warforged body.
		- This gave him dark powers, sourced from Rak Tulkesh's essence, which is trapped within. The only limit to his power being the remaining FKD fragments that are still out in the world.
		- Woe's soul, now heavily influenced by the Overlord of Rage, works fanatically under Mordakhesh's guidance.
		- ***Motivation:***
			- Forge's decision to sacrifice himself and all of his men, including Woe, caused Woe to become extremely tribal, going to extreme means to protect any he deems as 'his people', and to destroy any who he perceives as threatening their existence.
			- He seeks to reunite all of the *FKD* fragments and use that power to liberate his newfound race of Warforged, and wipe all who oppose him from the planet.

	- Mordakhesh
		- Lieutenant to Rak Tulkhesh
		- Commands the Lords of Dust & performed ritual on Woe
		- Has been hunting the FKD fragments for a long time
			- Ever since Varyn went looking for them
		- Has been guiding Woe to seek out the *FKD* fragments, telling him they will give him the power to achieve his own goals
		- Mardakhesh has kept a secret from Woe - the reunification of the FKD and its shards will allow Rak Tulkesh to use Woe's soul as a catalyst - destroying Rak Tulkesh's prison and allowing his avatar to once again claim dominion over Eberron, shattering Woe's soul in the process.

	- Hrothgar 
		- Bjorn's brother
		- Usurped Bjorn's position as the Chieftian of the Stormpeak Clan
		- Killed Draven and took his fractured dragonshard fragment and white flameblade, further increasing his power and dark influence on the surrounding land.

- **Factions**
	- House Cannith
		- The leader of Cannith south is Marix d'Cannith.
		- Marix ordered the use of the Steelhardt in the ritual involving Vorack.
		- He also put the hit out on Geralt's parents.

	- Church of the Silver Flame
		- ***Secret***: Doesn't actually know where the Silver Flame is kept.
		- ***Motivation:*** Find the Silver Flame and claim dominion over it, to protect it.

		- Are working with Baelen trying to locate the Silver Flame, giving him their resources.

	- Boromar clan
		- Seeks the Dragonshard and fragments for none other than the promise of wealth and power
		- Have been tracking Baelen ir'Torn
