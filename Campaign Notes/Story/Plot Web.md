## Story Plot Pieces
- **Themes**: 
	- What makes a person good? 
	- Better to be born good or overcome evil nature through great struggle?
	- Most villains aren't purely evil, just have their own justifications.
	- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?
- **Central Tension**: The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh
	- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. 
		- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed
			- How was it discovered?
		- Caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so
		- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world
		- Requires a sacrifice of a morally "silver" (silver is a shade of gray) character to revive

- **Significant NPCs**
	- **Varyn "The Valiant" Grayburn**
		- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl
		- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame
		- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons
			- Directly oppose actions of the Lords of Dust
			- A small group within felt that Clan Flameforge's scope was to narrow.
			- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.
		- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.
			- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.
			- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.
			- The LoD found out and also began a search.
			- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.
			- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.
		- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.
		- He saw the purity and potential within Draven
			- The darkness within the shard never affected him.
		- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:
			- The White Flameblade
			- The dragonshard fragment
		- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber

**Artifacts**
- Artifact 1: ***Fractured Khyber Dragonshard & Fragments***
	- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.
		- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of them, and have been hunting them down since.
		- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.
	- Contains imprisoned consciousness of Rak Tulkesh
	- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted
	- Who has them
		- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment
		- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment
		- Hrothgar: 1 fragment

- Artifact 2: ***White Flameblade***
	- Currently in Varyn's possession
	- Contains runes that tell of the location of the Silver Flame
		- Unlocks a portal in the Mournland that teleports to Vault deep under Xen'Drik jungle
		- sword was created by Varyn when vault was originally sealed, gave it to Draven
		- Varyn felt useless, saw potential in Draven as a protector
		- Aids in travel through the Mournland, glows blue when pointed in the correct direction

- Artifact 3: ***Steelhardt***
	- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.
	- Worked by attaching a willing consciousness to a Siberys Dragonshard, then implanting the device into a corpse.
	- Marix d'Cannith & the LoD wanted to use it to create an avatar that could wield Rak Tulkesh's power and destroy the Silver Flame
	- This failed because:
		- It was intended for a consciousness to take over a corpse, not to absorb a great power into a living body
		- The consciousness of an Overlord can never be contained within a Siberys Dragonshard, it is too closely connected to Siberys.
	- Instead, the power of Rak Tulkesh corrupted the shard within the device, along with Vorak's body. While this granted him increased power, it came at the cost of a short life.
	- However, when he attempted to destroy the Silver Flame, the awesome power of the Silver Flame broke the Steelhardt's protection mechanisms, allowing the corrupted power to consume Vorak completely. This gave him a quasi-immortality, similar to Lichdom, but cost him his individuality, turning him into a rage-fueled killer.
	- The only way to destroy Vorak is to complete a ritual that can 'cleanse' the corrupted shard within.
	- It can then be used as a way to 'cleanse' Woe?
		- It was made to store a consciousness, so it can be used to steal Rak Tulkesh's consciousness from the Fractured Dragonshard (once the fragments are reunited).

- **Villains**
	- Vorak
		- Underwent ritual before Woe using the Steelhardt and led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.
			- Due to an inherent failure in the Steelhardt, his attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, turning him into a rage-fueled creature of destruction, and allowing the Silver Flame to defend itself with the Mourning.
		- He was sent by Marix d'Cannith to kill Geralt's parents after they fled House Cannith.
		- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, feeding off the rage of the survivors, and using it to resurrect himself should he fall in battle.
		- Heart was replaced with the Steelhardt.
			- The survivors get the unrelenting urge to find Vorak and kill him, but if Vorak is dead they find the Steelhardt instead.
			- The rage consumed them, and forces them to plunge the artifact into their own chest, killing them, and allowing Vorak to resurrect through their body.
