## Story Plot Pieces

	- What makes a person good? 
	- Better to be born good or overcome evil nature through great struggle?
	- Most villains aren't purely evil, just have their own justifications.
	- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?
- **Central Tension**: The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh
	- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. 
		- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed
			- How was it discovered?
		- Caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so
		- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world
		- Requires a sacrifice of a morally "silver" (silver is a shade of gray) character to revive

- **Significant Characters**
	- **Varyn "The Valiant" Grayburn**
		- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl
		- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame

			- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.
		- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.
			- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.
			- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.
			- The LoD found out and also began a search.
			- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.
			- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existance, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.
		- Carries around a fractured dragonshard fragment
			- Corrupted Hrothgar during his birth.
			- Varyn left shortly after, returned to Clan Flameforge

			- The White Flameblade
			- The dragonshard fragment
		- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber

**Artifacts**
- Artifact 1: *Fractured Khyber Dragonshard & Fragments*
	- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.
		- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of them, and have been hunting them down since.
		- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.
	- Contains imprisoned consciousness of Rak Tulkesh
	- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted
	- Who has them
		- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment
		- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment
		- Varyn: 1 fragment
- Artifact 2: *White Flameblade*
	- Draven's white-hot flaming Sword contains runes that tell of the location of the Silver Flame
		- Unlocks a portal in the Mournland that teleports to Vault deep under Xen'Drik jungle
		- sword was created by Varyn when vault was originally sealed, gave it to Draven
		- Varyn felt useless, saw potential in Draven as a protector
		- Aids in travel through the Mournland, glows blue when pointed in the correct direction
- Artifact 3: *Steelhardt*
	- The Lords of Dust were not powerful enough to destroy the Silver Flame on their own
	- This allowed it to defend itself with the Mourning.
	- The LoD knew they needed to channel Rak Tulkesh's power into a vessel, which can then destroy the Flame when they find it again.
	- Created by House Cannith, this device was a failed attempt at that, before they located the Fractured Dragonshard.
	- It now acts as a focus for Garick's rage-fueled powers.

- **Villains**
	- Garick
		- Underwent ritual before Woe using the Steelhardt and led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.
			- Due to an inherent failure in the Steelhardt, his attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, turning him into a rage-fueled creature of destruction, and allowing the Silver Flame to defend itself with the Mourning.
		- He was sent by Marix d'Cannith to kill Geralt's parents after they fled House Cannith.
		- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, feeding off the rage of the survivors, and using it to resurrect himself should he fall in battle.
		- Heart was replaced with the Steelhardt.
			- The survivors get the unrelenting urge to find Garick and kill him, but if Garick is dead they find the Steelhardt instead.
			- The rage consumed them, and forces them to plunge the artifact into their own chest, killing them, and allowing Garick to resurrect through their body.
