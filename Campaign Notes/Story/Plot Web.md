		- Being unable to read them, he stole a page that had 'cool' designs and runes on it, also bearing the Gorgon seal of House Cannith.
		- He still has this page to this day.
		- A part of why he has learnt so many languages was to decode this page, but he was never able to.

#### PC: Forge
- ***Warforged Lore:***
	- Warforged are the man-made reincarnates of the fallen soldiers in the ; our eternity stolen from us, and our souls - repurposed as weapons in the war that took our life once already.
-  Human General of **House Cannith**
- In a **battle during the last war**, I sacrificed myself for my men and lost my life in an **explosion I set off to overtake the enemy**
- My soul, captured by House Cannith and **infused into a Warforged body**, I retained my memory (not known to have ever happened during the creation process)
- I broke free, escaped my creation forge, **destroyed all House Cannith creation forges,** and **liberated the warforged**
- Warforged were not liberated due to the Treaty of Thronehold. This treaty was a political move so that House Cannith would not have to admit that a Singular warforged destroyed all their forges (protecting themselves from judgment and taking control of the narrative to prevent a negative reputation)
- I had to go into hiding, my **House Cannith Dragonmark (dragonmark found on the designs of the Steelhardt? It started small but has continued growing on his body?)** on my torso and into my arms, legs, and neck transcended my once-living body and onto my forged body (not known to transcend to warforged, up to you if we settle for an aberrant dragonmark instead - I just feel this properly ties me to history and explains how I might be recognized)
- I caught wind of **another creation forge (In sharn? How did he find out?)**, explaining my presence outside the lighthouse during my introduction to the campaign
- Am I a fallen soldier **targetedly-reincarnated (maybe as an experimental prototype  - the first and only warforged reincarnated using a prototype of the Steelhardt?)** as a living weapon that liberated the remaining warforged, while simultaneously destroying our only means of creation and being responsible for the potential demise of my entire race?
- ***Character motivation:***
	- Is it unethical to create more in my image? Does that make me a God, or does that make me one of you?

## Story Plot Pieces
- **Themes**:
	- What makes a person good? 
	- Most villains aren't purely evil, but have their own justifications.
	- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?
	- If one has only known evil since birth, are they redeemable or can they overcome that nature? 

- **Central Tension**: The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh
	- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. 
		- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed
		- The silver flame caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so
		- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world

		- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame
		- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons

			- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.
		- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.
			- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.
			- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.
			- The LoD found out and also began a search.
			- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.
			- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.
		- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.
		- He saw the purity and potential within Draven
			- The darkness within the shard never affected him.
		- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:
			- The White Flameblade
			- The dragonshard fragment
		- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber

	- Aeren d'Cannith
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To discover the extent of House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning
		- Was adopted into House Cannith about 20 years ago at the age of 18 y/o as the Youngest Master Artificer (and only Master Artificer without a Mark of Creation) ever named within the house.
			- Due to his invention of the ingenious Everbright Lantern
		- He is now the Mentor to Miri, the magewright currently living in Shavelant.
		- Aeren knew Geralt's parents for a short time when he was adopted into the House.
		- He does not know what Geralt's schematics say, but he knows that they are written in Sibernyan
		- He knows House Cannith had something to do with the Day of Mourning, and is trying to find out more. (needs development: why does he know something is up?)

**Artifacts**
- Artifact 1: ***Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD) & Fragments***
	- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.
		- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of them, and have been hunting them down since.
		- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.
	- Contains imprisoned consciousness of Rak Tulkesh
	- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted
	- Who has them
		- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment
		- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment (Needs development, where/how did he find it?)
		- Hrothgar: 1 fragment, obtained from Draven when Hrothgar battled and killed him

- Artifact 2: ***Etherseraph***
	- Currently in Varyn's possession, obtained when he battled and killed Draven
	- Contains runes that tell of the location of the Silver Flame
		- Unlocks a portal in the Mournland that teleports to Vault deep under Xen'Drik jungle
		- sword was created by Varyn when vault was originally sealed, gave it to Draven
		- Varyn felt useless, saw potential in Draven as a protector
		- Aids in travel through the Mournland, glows blue when pointed in the correct direction

- Artifact 3: ***Steelhardt***
	- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.
	- Worked by attaching a willing soul to a Siberys Dragonshard, then implanting the device into a corpse.
	- Marix d'Cannith & the LoD wanted to use it to create an avatar that could wield Rak Tulkesh's power and destroy the Silver Flame
	- This failed because:
		- It was intended for a consciousness to take over a corpse, not to absorb a great power into a living body
		- The consciousness of an Overlord can never be contained within a Siberys Dragonshard, it is too closely connected to Siberys.
	- Instead, the power of Rak Tulkesh corrupted the shard within the device, along with Vorak's body. While this granted him increased power, it came at the cost of a short life.
	- However, when he attempted to destroy the Silver Flame, the awesome power of the Silver Flame broke the Steelhardt's protection mechanisms, allowing the corrupted power to consume Vorak completely. This gave him a quasi-immortality, similar to Lichdom, but cost him his individuality, turning him into a rage-fueled killer.
	- The only way to destroy Vorak is to complete a ritual that can 'cleanse' the corrupted shard within.
	- It can then be used as a way to 'cleanse' Woe?
		- It was made to store a consciousness, so it can be used to steal Rak Tulkesh's consciousness from the Fractured Dragonshard (once the fragments are reunited).

- **Villains**
	- Vorak
		- Underwent ritual before Woe using the Steelhardt and led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.
			- Due to an inherent failure in the Steelhardt, his attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, turning him into a rage-fueled creature of destruction, and allowing the Silver Flame to defend itself with the Mourning.
		- He was sent by Marix d'Clone to kill Geralt's parents after they fled House Cannith.
		- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, feeding off the rage of the survivors, and using it to resurrect himself should he fall in battle.
		- Heart was replaced with the Steelhardt.
			- The survivors get the unrelenting urge to find Vorak and kill him, but if Vorak is dead they find the Steelhardt instead.
			- The rage consumed them, and forces them to plunge the artifact into their own chest, killing them, and allowing Vorak to resurrect through their body.

	- Woe
		- Was killed by Lick's father who was wearing a dragonshard fragment, during a battle in the Last War.
		- He was revived by Mordakesh and the resources of the Lords of Dust.
		- He accepted a deal from Mordakesh to undergo a profane ritual, implanting the main piece of the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard into his chest.
		- This gave him dark powers, sourced from Rak Tulkesh's consciousness, which is trapped within.
		- With the whispers of Rak Tulkesh in his head, he seeks to reunite the shard fragments and use the power to unleash the Overlord upon Eberron once again.

- **Factions**
	- House Cannith
		- The leader of Cannith south is Marix d'Cannith.
			- He was kidnapped and replaced by a shape-shifting agent (AKA Marix d'Clone) sometime before the Steelhardt was completed and used on Vorack.
			- The real Marix is being held? Or is he dead?
		- Marix d'Clone ordered the use of the Steelhardt in the ritual involving Vorack.
		- He also put the hit out on Geralt's parents.
		- ***Secret***: Marix d'Cannith was replaced by a LoD shapeshifter several years ago, before the Day of Mourning.
		- (Needs developing: Who is the shapeshifter specifically? What are his motivations?)
