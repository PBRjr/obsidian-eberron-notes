### Arrival at Sharn


**Via lightning rail at Terminus Station.**
As you step off the lightning rail coach, the cacophony of Terminus Station washes over you. The air hums with the energy of a thousand voices, all clamoring, bartering, and calling out greetings or farewells. The station itself is a colossal structure, its high, vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns of dark, polished wood. Enormous everbright lanterns hang from the ceiling, bathing the station in a warm, welcoming glow.

Before you can even take a breath, you're surrounded by a swarm of people. Porters push their way through the throng, their carts piled high with luggage and crates. Skycoach drivers tout the speed and comfort of their vehicles, hoping to lure travelers to their flying chariots. Guides, their faces eager and hopeful, offer their services to help navigate the labyrinthine city. And of course, there are the inevitable beggars, their pleas for alms blending into the general din.

Through the crowd, you can see the many shops and stalls that line the edges of the station. House Orien maintains a strong presence here, with offices for arranging transport and shipping, as well as a small enclave for its heirs. House Sivis has a message station here, and House Deneith has a small outpost where you can hire bodyguards or laborers. House Vadalis even operates a large stable and hostelry, should you need to secure your mounts while exploring the city.

**Via land road at Wroann's Gate.**
As you approach the colossal entrance to the City of Towers, you begin to understand the depth of its name. A breathtaking panorama of soaring spires and towering structures stretches before you, reaching up into the sky as if to pierce the heavens themselves. The sheer scale of the city is overwhelming, and you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.

The gate itself is a marvel of engineering, a massive archway carved from black granite and topped by a titanic statue of Queen Wroann of Breland. The queen holds a scepter in one hand and a sword above her head.

The streets of Wroann's Gate teem with life. Merchants and traders hawk their wares, their voices blending into a cacophony of sound. Travelers from across Khorvaire mingle with the city's residents, their faces reflecting a myriad of cultures and backgrounds. Skycoaches flit through the air like giant dragonflies, carrying passengers to their destinations. And beneath it all, you can hear the constant hum of the Cogs, the beating heart of Sharn's industry.

Crossing the threshold into the impossibly tall city, the first thing that hits you is the smell. It's a complex, ever-shifting blend of a thousand different scents: the tang of smoke and sulfur from the Cogs, the sweet aroma of exotic spices, the stench of sewage and garbage, and the faint but unmistakable fragrance of magic.

The next thing you notice is the noise. Sharn is a city that never sleeps, and the din of its inhabitants is constant. You hear the shouts of merchants hawking their wares, the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the rhythmic clang of hammers in the Cogs, and the distant roar of the crowds in the entertainment districts. It's a noise that can be overwhelming at first, but it's also a noise that pulsates with life and energy.

You're struck by the diversity of the city's inhabitants. Humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and even more exotic creatures all rub shoulders in the crowded streets. You see merchants from the Lhazaar Principalities haggling with traders from the Mror Holds. You see warforged laborers hauling goods alongside halfling teamsters. You see goblin families begging for alms, their faces etched with the hardship of life in the lower wards.

She claims to be a seer, and offers her services in exchange for help.

### Reading of Fate

Bjorn's reading
>  Ahh, the Bearwolf. The storm within you rages, your heart torn between duty and blood. Yes, I feel your fury, one that is matched only by the darkness that taints your brother's soul. And in the tidal forces of your anger lies a riptide of betrayal, confusion, and... grief. In time, he will know your pain, and your anger will be his fuel, for your destiny was forged in flame and storm long ago.

Draven's reading:
> A knight of many names, and yet you've barely begun to rediscover what any of them mean to you. The Knight's own mind betrays him, a Valiant sacrifice your curse and your savior. Your mind is shrouded in mist, your memories hidden to you. Its barely perceivable, but you know something is very wrong. Its as if a subtle noise that was comforting your ear has suddenly been snuffed out, its absence your only hint at its presence. Will the light of Siberys grant you divine clarity? Or has it already killed the knight, his body not yet informed?

Geralt's reading:
> The lost child, a wolf born of oak and stone, bird song and a quiet breeze your comfort, your solace, a second home created out of the destruction of another. The creations of man have ripped so much from you. Yes... I feel anger and disgust. But is it born only from what has been taken from you? Or is part of it from knowing, deep down, that your only chance of discovering why you lost everything lies in the story of your family's still-beating heart?

## Encounters
### Dialogue between 2 kobolds
**Nasally Kobold**: "Hey, did you see Brains? He all twitchy and scribbling again."

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Yeah, he mad 'bout the last bunch. Not right for the big wake-up thing. He say Woe trick us."

**Nasally Kobold**: "He keep saying 'need willing ones.' What that mean? We just grab what Woe give, right?"

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Shh! Don't let Brains hear ya. He think he big thinker, say he got plan. But some say he not know anything."

**Nasally Kobold**: "Bah, just want big fire and boom like in prophecy. Brains better be right, or maybe we find new boss, huh?"
### Brain's mutterances

- "Others whisper, whisper behind Brains. They think Brains not know... but Brains smartest! Must show them, must prove!"
- "If not get right one, all bad. All bad for Brains. Others get angry, maybe want new leader. No, no, can't let that happen."
## Enemy goals
- Want to summon [[Argonnessen#Secrets|The Daughter of Khyber]] by doing a ritual sacrifice of a "*Willing Dragon Kin*".
	- They misinterpreted this as any Dragonborn/Kobolds, not a willing dragon that has to sacrifice itself.
- This sacrifice is a mistaken ancient take on a part of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] that states if a willing dragon kin is sacrificed in a very particular set of circumstances, The Daughter of Khyber will be freed.

### Prophecy Fragment concerning Tiamat
> In the hour when shadows grow long and the moon bleeds its light, the Daughter of Khyber shall stir in her dark slumber. Only then, if the kin of dragons, willing in heart and spirit, offers itself unto the void, shall the chains of the Daughter weaken. Her roar shall echo through the Five Sorrows, and the world shall tremble before her awakening.

### Ritual in the Kogs


Location: [[Kogs Ritual Chamber]]

**Ritual Completion and Dismissal by Mordakhesh**:

- As the ritual concludes, the air thick with arcane energy, Mordakhesh steps back from the altar. He observes Woe, who is still recovering from the procedure. With a slight tone of concern mixed with command, Mordakhesh advises, "Rest now, let the shard’s essence meld with your own. But first, dispose of our uninvited guests." This comment is made dismissively, without even a glance at the party, underscoring their perceived insignificance.

**Woe's Awakening**:

- Woe lethargically sits up, his eyes flashing with newly imbued purple energy. He lazily stretches a hand towards a dormant piece of machinery nearby. As his fingers twitch, a burst of purple energy flows from his hand into the machine, which whirs to life, its mechanical eyes glowing with the same ominous purple.
- He watches with mild interest, a slight smirk on his face, as the machine turns towards the party, ready to attack.

**Combat Dynamics**:

- The enchanted machine, powered by the dragonshard’s essence, aggressively targets the party. Describe the machine’s movements as unnaturally swift and powerful, enhanced by the magical energy.
- Throughout the fight, as the party manages to damage the machine, Woe, with minimal effort, could casually redirect his energy to enchant other machinery in the room to join the fray, each time causing the cavern to rumble ominously.

**Environmental Collapse and Escape Routes**:

- The ongoing battle and the unstable arcane energy cause the cavern to shake violently. Debris falls, blocking the path they originally took while conveniently opening up another route that leads deeper into the maze of the Kogs and possibly exits near an unexpected part of Sharn.
- As the party battles or decides to flee, they notice the structural integrity of the cavern degrading, hinting that staying much longer could be fatal.

**The Magic’s Limit and Woe's Disinterest**:

- If the party manages to distance themselves from the animated machinery, perhaps through clever maneuvering or by making a dash for the new escape route, they'll notice the purple energy begins to fade from the machines, causing them to slow and eventually stop, unable to pursue further.
- Woe assumes the machines have dealt with the party or that they are no longer his problem. He dismisses them from his mind and exits via his own means, perhaps a portal or cloaked in a shroud of shadows, to recover from the ritual’s exertions.

### Conclusion and Aftermath:

- Once safe, the party can regroup and process the sheer power and threat Woe represents. This encounter not only sets up Woe as a formidable foe but also deepens the mystery and danger of what he and Mordakhesh are planning.
- This experience can lead to new objectives, such as finding ways to counteract or dismantle the dragonshard’s influence, or investigating other areas of Sharn that might hold the key to stopping Woe’s machinations.

### Sharn Tension Encounters


Here is a table with some brief encounter ideas for Sharn and related details to help the DM if players investigate further:

| Encounter | Details for DM |
|-|-|  
| A tiefling preacher rants about "end times" while fearful citizens hurry past. | The preacher is a madman named Jorik who claims to receive visions of doom. DC 15 Insight check reveals he seems sincere in his beliefs. |
| Guards question a ragged half-orc about spotting 'Tarks'. | The guards are referring to House Tarkanan agents rumored to be in the area. The half-orc knows nothing. |
| An elf peddles rare demonic tomes from a cart for exorbitant prices. | The elf is a black market dealer named Talian who sells books about devils and demons, including one titled '[[Misc Books and Texts#In the Details An Exploration of Devil Sociology\|In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology]].' |
| A drunk dwarf mutters about the "flame dying out" before being hushed. | He's referring to a secret cult that believes the Silver Flame is fading. DC 13 Persuasion could convince him to share meeting location. |  
| Guards discuss "troubling omens" in hushed tones. | Omens include unnatural fog, aberrant creature sightings, and night terrors afflicting citizens. |
| Strange symbols warn of "ancient lords" and "serpents." | DC 11 Religion or Arcana check identifies them as connected to Overlords of the First Age. |
| An urchin slips a warning about "enemies in masks." | The urchin knows little but has overheard things suggesting shapeshifters or changelings are operating in the city. |
| Cries ring out from a home before a bloodied resident calmly exits. | DC 13 Insight suspects they are under some kind of charm or mind control magic. |
| Guards extinguish blazes sparked by strange green flames. | The flames radiate conjuration magic and have appeared in seemingly random spots around the city. |
