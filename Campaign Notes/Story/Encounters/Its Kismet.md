### Its Kismet
**Kismet** is one of the personas of ***The Traveler***, the first hag to walk upon Eberron, born of the Age of Demons. Being the first, Kismet is so powerful her effect on the land is now worshipped as godhood. 

Kismet presents herself as a frazzled old half-elf woman, with a weak frame and loose skin. She claims her wagon, which is seen filled with various trade goods, lost a wheel, and that she needs help repairing it so she may continue her journey.

She claims to be a seer, and offers her services in exchange for help.

### Reading of Fate

Bjorn's reading
>  Ahh, the Bearwolf. The storm within you rages, your heart torn between duty and blood. Yes, I feel your fury, one that is matched only by the darkness that taints your brother's soul. And in the tidal forces of your anger lies a riptide of betrayal, confusion, and... grief. In time, he will know your pain, and your anger will be his fuel, for your destiny was forged in flame and storm long ago.

Draven's reading:
> A man of many names, and yet you've barely begun to discover what any one of them mean to you. The Knight's own mind betrays him, a Valiant sacrifice your curse and your savior. Your mind is shrouded in mist, your memories hidden to you. Its barely perceivable, but you know something is very wrong. Its as if a subtle noise that was comforting your ear has suddenly been turned off. Will the light of Siberys grant you divine clarity? Or has it already killed you with its power, your body not yet informed?

Geralt's reading:
> The lost child, a wolf born of oak and stone, bird song and a quiet breeze your comfort, your solace, a second home created out of the destruction of another. The creations of man have ripped so much from you. Yes... I feel anger and disgust. But is it born only from what has been taken from you? Or is part of it from knowing, deep down, that your only chance of discovering why you lost everything lies in the story of your family's still-beating heart?
