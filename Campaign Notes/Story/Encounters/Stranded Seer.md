### Its Kismet
**Kismet** is an old dwarven woman that claims to be a seer, able to read the 'fate lines' of people. She wanders the land, setting up shop in towns then moving on after a few days, never visiting the same place twice.

He is old an mysterious, though friendly and comforting. She knows when to say something wise.

Her wagon lost a wheel during her travels, and the party encounters her along a road. She offers a free reading of their fate lines if they aid her in repairing her wagon so she may return to her travels.
