**Kismet** is an old dwarven woman that claims to be a seer, able to read the 'fate lines' of people. She wanders the land, setting up shop in towns then moving on after a few days, never visiting the same place twice.

He is old an mysterious, though friendly and comforting. She knows when to say something wise.

Her wagon lost a wheel during her travels, and the party encounters her along a road. She offers a free reading of their fate lines if they aid her in repairing her wagon so she may return to her travels.

### Reading of Fate

Bjorn's reading
>  Ahh, the Bearwolf. The storm within you rages, your heart torn between duty and blood. Yes, I feel your fury, one that is matched only by the darkness that taint's your brother's soul. And in the tidal forces of your anger lies a riptide of betrayal, confusion, and... grief. In time, he will know your pain, your anger his fuel, for your destiny was forged in flame and storm.

Draven's reading:
> A man of many names, and yet you've barely begun to discover what any one of them mean to you. The Knight's own mind betrays him, a Valiant sacrifice your curse and your savior. Will the light of Siberys grant you divine clarity? Or has it already killed you, your body not yet informed?

Geralt's reading:
> The lost child, a wolf born of oak and stone, bird song and a quiet breeze your comfort, your solace, a second home created out of the destruction of another. The creations of man have taken so much from you. Yes... I feel anger and disgust. But is it born only from what has been taken from you? Or is it knowing, deep down, that your only chance of discovering why you lost everything lies in the origin of your family's heart?
