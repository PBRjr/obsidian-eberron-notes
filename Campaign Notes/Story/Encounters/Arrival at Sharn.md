**Via lightning rail at Terminus Station.**
As you step off the lightning rail coach, the cacophony of Terminus Station washes over you. The air hums with the energy of a thousand voices, all clamoring, bartering, and calling out greetings or farewells. The station itself is a colossal structure, its high, vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns of dark, polished wood. Enormous everbright lanterns hang from the ceiling, bathing the station in a warm, welcoming glow.

Before you can even take a breath, you're surrounded by a swarm of people. Porters push their way through the throng, their carts piled high with luggage and crates. Skycoach drivers tout the speed and comfort of their vehicles, hoping to lure travelers to their flying chariots. Guides, their faces eager and hopeful, offer their services to help navigate the labyrinthine city. And of course, there are the inevitable beggars, their pleas for alms blending into the general din.

Through the crowd, you can see the many shops and stalls that line the edges of the station. House Orien maintains a strong presence here, with offices for arranging transport and shipping, as well as a small enclave for its heirs. House Sivis has a message station here, and House Deneith has a small outpost where you can hire bodyguards or laborers. House Vadalis even operates a large stable and hostelry, should you need to secure your mounts while exploring the city.

**Via land road at Wroann's Gate.**
As you pass through the colossal Wroann's Gate, the City of Towers truly lives up to its name. A breathtaking panorama of soaring spires and towering structures stretches before you, reaching up into the sky as if to pierce the heavens themselves. The sheer scale of the city is overwhelming, and you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.

The gate itself is a marvel of engineering, a massive archway carved from black granite and topped by a titanic statue of Queen Wroann. The queen holds a scepter in one hand and a sword above her head, a symbol of the power and authority of Breland.

The streets of Wroann's Gate teem with life. Merchants and traders hawk their wares, their voices blending into a cacophony of sound. Travelers from across Khorvaire mingle with the city's residents, their faces reflecting a myriad of cultures and backgrounds. Skycoaches flit through the air like giant dragonflies, carrying passengers to their destinations. And beneath it all, you can hear the constant hum of the Cogs, the beating heart of Sharn's industry.

As you step through Wroann's Gate, the first thing that hits you is the smell. It's a complex, ever-shifting blend of a thousand different scents: the tang of smoke and sulfur from the Cogs, the sweet aroma of exotic spices, the stench of sewage and garbage, and the faint but unmistakable fragrance of magic. It's a smell that you'll never forget, a smell that will forever be associated with the City of Towers.

The next thing you notice is the noise. Sharn is a city that never sleeps, and the din of its inhabitants is constant. You hear the shouts of merchants hawking their wares, the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the rhythmic clang of hammers in the Cogs, and the distant roar of the crowds in the entertainment districts. It's a noise that can be overwhelming at first, but it's also a noise that pulsates with life and energy.

As you make your way through the gate, you're immediately struck by the diversity of the city's inhabitants. Humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and even more exotic creatures all rub shoulders in the crowded streets. You see merchants from the Lhazaar Principalities haggling with traders from the Mror Holds. You see warforged laborers hauling goods alongside human teamsters. You see goblin families begging for alms, their faces etched with the hardship of life in the lower wards.
