**Via lightning rail at Terminus Station.**
As you step off the lightning rail coach, the cacophony of Terminus Station washes over you. The air hums with the energy of a thousand voices, all clamoring, bartering, and calling out greetings or farewells. The station itself is a colossal structure, its high, vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns of dark, polished wood. Enormous everbright lanterns hang from the ceiling, bathing the station in a warm, welcoming glow.

Before you can even take a breath, you're surrounded by a swarm of people. Porters push their way through the throng, their carts piled high with luggage and crates. Skycoach drivers tout the speed and comfort of their vehicles, hoping to lure travelers to their flying chariots. Guides, their faces eager and hopeful, offer their services to help navigate the labyrinthine city. And of course, there are the inevitable beggars, their pleas for alms blending into the general din.

Through the crowd, you can see the many shops and stalls that line the edges of the station. House Orien maintains a strong presence here, with offices for arranging transport and shipping, as well as a small enclave for its heirs. House Sivis has a message station here, and House Deneith has a small outpost where you can hire bodyguards or laborers. House Vadalis even operates a large stable and hostelry, should you need to secure your mounts while exploring the city.
