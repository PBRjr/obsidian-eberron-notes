- Originally a cowardly man that got lost in the bag after hiding in one when his party was attacked.
- Now, lost in the interdimensional space between bags of holding, he hops from bag to bag, seeking out others to drag into the bag with him.
- Repeating "Follow my voice" 3 times into a bag of holding will summon the Bag Man.
