### Session 1 Lead-in


 Dried blood cakes Khorvaire like topsoil, giving way to the blooming flowers of greed, selfishness, and violence. Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. 

102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. 

Blood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.

Powerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. 

House Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.

With no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.

Then 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. 

The signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.

Still, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.

Our story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. 

Deckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.

The smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.

A tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. 

Bjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?

- DOES KNOW & WON'T GIVE UP: Bosses name, anything that humiliates him, anything that can be directly used against the clan.
- DOES NOT KNOW: Castar's motives, deeper questions about the workings of the clan.

_Plot Information_
- Seeks to bring the town under Boromar control through protection racket and intimidation. Reason clan wants to control Shavalant:
	- Water tower is a unique piece of magitech - knowledge of workings could be worth good money

Person 2: Orc 1 & 3

- Dumb and strong. Will not succumb to physical torture, can be easily tricked into giving up information.
- DO KNOW: they were told to 'keep an eye' on Garhorn.
- DO NOT KNOW: Much else. Basic info about the clan.

_Plot Information_

- Typical brutes, low knowledge of clan workings, low knowledge of current job. Loyal to Halak Boromar, were sent along with Garhorn as Halak's way of keeping an eye on things.
- Many such 'guards' were sent along with Castar's men as a result of the inner conflict of the Clan

Person 3: [[Its Kismet|Kismet]]

- Will find a way to convince the PCs to have their fates read.
- Appears as small graying half-elf woman, acts a bit crazy.

Person 4: Oak Dryfire

- A young orc boy that provides light hearted roleplay opportunity and reveals Draven's status as a known hero.

Person 5: Chewy

- The Kobold that was covered in oil in session 2 that escaped and was captured by the gang members. Will be very scared.
- DOES KNOW: SotDoK is a fairly new group put together by Brains in an effort to create his own clan, he was always vague about their rituals, kept information to himself. Demanded a lot from the members.
- DOES NOT KNOW: Who Woe is, why they attacked the airship, why they took Marsh.

_Plot Information_

- Killed Orc 1 and Orc 3 during the encounter.
- They healed and interrogated the captured Kobold, who told them that the Sons of the Daughter of Khyber were a very make-shift and disorganized cult. He also told them Brains struck a deal with Woe to take down the airship in session 1 so they could get more people to sacrifice, though he didn't know Woe's name.
	- The party let the kobold escape.
- Let Garhorn and his blink dog Flicker leave alive, along with one of their horses (the one that demanded carrots from Geralt when he used speak with animals).
	- The party did not search Garhorn, he left with his sending stone and special lockpicking set.
	- Garhorn will travel to the closest known Boromar safe house and get aid. He used his sending stone to contact his superior and order a hit out on the party. He will also return to Shavalant with more gang members and burn the town to the ground since they aided the party.
	- PCs took the remaining horse from camp (the one that was very thankful for the apple Geralt fed it).

The party returned to Shavalant soon after, and went to talk to Miri.

- Miri was concerned at how they handled it, though she was grateful they helped at all.
	- She is afraid that Garhorn will send for more muscle and come back to burn the town to the ground.
	- She relays to the party that she spoke with her mentor Aeren d'Cannith, and that he needs the names of the party so he can aid them through the Sharn gates once they arrive.
	- Miri also told the PCs that he was intrigued about Geralt's steelhardt schematics, though he wouldn't reveal anything over sending stone.
	- (Aeren will recognize Geralt's last name and will begin looking into his family further, suspecting they are connected to House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning.)
- Sheriff Cromley showed up at Miri's workshop during this conversation, very irate. He asked the party to leave, and payed for another horse they could ride out of town.
	- He is concered for the same reasons Miri is, though he is less grateful towards the party than her.
- The PCs stopped by Prissy's apothecary on the way out, and she gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth as thanks for delivering news of her son's passing (which happened in session 1).
- They read the intel letter concernig Baelen and his group of CotSF guards and planned on heading to Sharn, with a possible detour to Castle Arakhain (AKA "The Lighthouse") to investigate a potential lead on the purple crystal he has, hoping to discover more about Woe.

During first day of travel they completed the "It's Kismet" encounter.
- Helped her repair her wagon using some glue she had.
- She announced herself as a seer and offered palm readings. Things got weird fast and she gave their fate readings detailed in the encounter.
- The party left shortly after, a bit freaked out.
- Bjorn was less jolted by the encounter, due to his mother being the Stormpeak Clan's seer.

Found the remains of the skirmish between Baelen's guards and the LoD ambush.
- Found the initial clues about the ambush, investigated the scene a bit.
- Bjorn spotted the path leading towards the creek bed that contains the dead Knight Templar.
