## Arc Setup
Story arcs are set up in a very specific way that is shown below. The idea is that at least one of these arcs is being moved forward every session. This is combined with a more extensive plot web to create a  cohesive and intuitive narrative experience for the players.

If a list under an Arc is numbered, this represents the order of priority, not necessarily the order it will be completed. The plot points towards the top of each list are more significant, while the ones towards the bottom may be less significant to the main plot, and more prone to being changed or discarded.

Each arc has a "completion point" which indicates when that arc will be wrapped up and the next one will begin.

Arcs do not have to be completed in any particular order, and many immediate arcs may be completed before a narrative arc is completed (or even before it becomes the main focus).

##### Immediate Arc
- This is what the players are attempting to accomplish at this moment or in the immediate future.
- Each is generally wrapped up within a few sessions
- Generally can be extrapolated from sub-plots of narrative arcs
- Thought of in terms of short-term, obvious, and achievable goals, like episodes of a TV show
	- Ex.: *Obtain horses to improve travel on the long roads ahead*
	- Ex. 2: *Assist an apothecary that you encountered on your journey*

##### Narrative Arc
- This is what the collective immediate arcs are building towards
- Each is generally wrapped up with their own satisfying and self-contained storylines
- Thought of in terms of seasons of a TV show. Goals are more long-term and may not be immediately obvious to PCs
	- Ex.: *Safely travel around the nation and make it to the City of Towers*
	- Ex. 2: *Figure out why tensions are high in Sharn and fix it.*

##### Campaign Arc
- The overall theme or main arc of the entire campaign
- Built up to by each narrative arc, becoming more obvious as the game goes on
- Completion of this arc marks the end of the campaign
- Should provide a satisfying ending that involves the culmination of everything the PCs have accomplished so far
	- Ex.: *The final fight with the ultimate BBEG*
