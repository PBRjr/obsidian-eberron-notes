Raided the boromar gang campsite
- Found Garhorn's ledger, his intel on Baelen ir'Torn, and his map of Khorvaire, in addition to loot listed below.
- Killed Orc 1 and Orc 3 during the encounter.
- They healed and interrogated the captured Kobold, who told them that the Sons of the Daughter of Khyber were a very make-shift and disorganized cult. He also told them Brains struck a deal with Woe to take down the airship in session 1 so they could get more people to sacrifice, though he didn't know Woe's name.
	- The party let the kobold escape.
- Let Garhorn and his blink dog Flicker leave alive, along with one of their horses (the one that demanded carrots from Geralt when he used speak with animals).
	- The party did not search Garhorn, he left with his sending stone and special lockpicking set.
	- Garhorn will travel to the closest known Boromar safe house and get aid. He used his sending stone to contact his superior and order a hit out on the party. He will also return to Shavalant with more gang members and burn the town to the ground since they aided the party.
	- PCs took the remaining horse from camp (the one that was very thankful for the apple Geralt fed it).

The party returned to Shavalant soon after, and scared the townsfolk
- Sheriff Cromley asked them to leave, payed for horses out of there
- Prissy gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth
- They read the intel letter and plan to head to Sharn by horse and try to find the professor they heard about
- Heading south.
- Encountered Kismet, got their fate readings, left really fast after they got freaked out. They helped her repair her wagon.
- Came upon the scene of the KotSF and Lod agents and camped nearby.
