TODO:
-  Lox's arc - Mordakesh may try to communicate telepathically with Lox and give him a goal.
	- What's the goal? It must seem insignificant to Lox so he will actually try to accomplish it.
- Agent's of woe encounter?
### Outline
- You're being watched (start)
- [[Legacy Stone]]
- Shamukaar (Kazrak elects to leave)

### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] Session Start
	- While traveling down the narrow water channel, someone in the party feels like they're being watched.
	- Woe attempts to scry on Forge. Due to him having served under Forge, Forge will have a -8 to this wisdom saving throw.

- [ ] Moment 1: *Legacy Stone*
	- Geralt experiences another vision from the [[Legacy Stone]]
	- This could send Geralt into unconsciousness if his player can't make the session
	- Makes the session all about escaping to the surface and finding a healer

- [ ] Moment 2: *Mordakhesh's favor*
	- While floating along through the tunnel, Lox is communicated with by his Patron, who he does not know is Mordakhesh.
	- The scenery changes to reflect a beautiful garden set in the courtyard of a stone castle. Colorful flowers blow in the wind. A cloaked figure stands tall with his back to Lox, his hands clasped behind his back. His hands are his only feature not shrouded in a cloak, and they appear to be human.
	- Mordakhesh requests a favor from Lox.
		- *"During your travels you will encounter a... 'thing' that calls itself Vorak." The origin of this creature is of no import, as it is but a shell of its former glory. Normally I would pay no heed to such a disappointment, however within that outer shell lives a... prize. A prize that, should you recover it and bring it to me, may sooth your grief and repair your... broken heart. ""*
		- *Your patron takes a look to his left, then to his right, as if taking in his surroundings for the first time since you've been here. "Lords, I hate places like this. Its one of mankind's greatest illusions, to build a structure as grand as this out of stone and brick, then claim these structures could stand for a millennia. 'Stone can outlast time itself', they would say.* 
		- *What they don't understand is that its not the stone that gives way, allowing intruders into one's castle. Its the decay of order that destroys civilizations. Because a wall requires maintenance, requires order. Without that, a wall of stone will always decay into nothing but a pile of rocks.*
		* *Find the creature and return to me what lies within the shell, and you will get your prize.*

- [ ] Moment 3: The Rapids
	- The narrow channel opens up slightly, and the water begins to travel faster, soon leading to rapids. This channel may no longer be traveled against the current via non-magical means.
	- A small metal crate with 2 potions of greater healing can be found floating in water, stuck against some rocks. **DC 15 acrobatics/athletics** check to grab the crate.
	- The channel comes to a dead end, with a ladder on the cavern wall leading upwards through a small tunnel, into ***Moment 3.***

- [ ] Moment 4: Shamukaar
	 - The players arrive through *the old well.*
	 - Kozrak knows that he is not welcome here, and chooses to leave the party and return to the surface.
	 - Various patrons of different species intermingle here. 
		 - Information may be sought from different NPCs.
			 - **What do the schematics say/What language are they in?**
				* What type of person/monster might have this kind of information here?
			* **Who is Woe?**
				* Many will have knowledge of him. They will know his name, and that he serves a master/higher power.
				* Most patrons are scared of Woe and his organization's power. A select few might even know of its name: *The Lords of Dust.*
	- A few agents of Woe are planted here and will follow/observe the party (NEEDS DEVELOPMENT)

- [ ] Session End: *Name*
- (possible cliffhanger)
