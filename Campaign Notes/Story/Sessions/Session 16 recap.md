Made it back to aeren's to find it ransacked
	- Tried to track down forge and piston who escaped before House Cannith could find them
	- Where did they go?
- Tabitha's Terrible Tavern - where Draven's Mastiff led the party in search for Piston
	- Grimy and dirty abandoned tavern
	- Piston lay inside on the counter
	- Forge left a note next to piston
		- "Had to hide, I'll find you -F"
Finished the alleyway encounter, went back into Tabitha's Terrible Tavern and long rested
- Geralt experienced another legacy stone vision
	- Was left at 1hp and with the poisoned condition.

They got loaded onto a freight car thanks to Brother Tiron
- He covered Lox in syrup and wrote "fat bastard" on his face, then had the party deposit him in a box with chicken feathers, after he was high on dreamlily
- the train takes off to Wroat
