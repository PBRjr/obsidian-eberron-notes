### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] Mission Brief
	- The party meets up with Kazrak before they infiltrate the Boromar HQ
	- He briefs them on the options for entry, objectives, and possible threats
	- Kazrak will have a squad of airships surrounding the HQ, as well as a squad of foot solders surrounding the docking point.
	- Kazrak's people won't go in first because he doesn't want to spook the clan into killing the captives.
	- **Options for entry.**
		- The Dock
		- Speed ship approach
	- **Objectives**
		- Rescue Aaron d'Cannith and Professor Baelin ir'Torn
	- **Threats**
		- The skeleton crew
		- Air defenses (cannons built into multiple floors, ballista & harpoons on the rooftop)
	- **Extra gear**
		- Modified Sending Stone earpieces
			- Allows the party to communicate with each other & Kazrak during the mission.
		- Feather fall coins
			- May be activated 1 time to grant the user 1 minute of "Feather Fall"
			- Disguised as Boromar Clan pendants
		- Boromar disguises
	- Key points.
		- *"Once they discover we're moving on them like this, they'll likely kill the prisoners"*
		- *"Once you rescue the prisoners we will move in."*


- [ ] Moment 1: *The Approach*
- **Approach 1: The dock**
	- Most straight-forward approach, from the dock that connects to the floating HQ.
	- "Main doors"
	- Will be a guard post to get through
	- *Challenge*
		- ID checks 
- **Approach 2: Speed ship approach**
	- More risky due to anti-air weapons
	- A smaller airship will get the party close enough to jump and attach to the walls of the HQ and infiltrate a lower level through windows
	- Kazrak will supply grapple equipment as well as window cutters.
	- *Challenge*
		- Attack rolls to test grapple points
		- Slight of hand checks to determine window-cutting speed


- [ ] Moment 2: *Clan Unrest*
	- The party hears rumblings of unrest as they explore the base
	- It is obviously undermanned and the staff/guards seem uneasy
	- Guards talk about divided loyalties
	- Party hears mention of "The professor" and "The Artificer" being separated because they were "plotting and planning"
		- *"Put the artificer to work scrubbing the crews floors"*
		- *"Locked that puny professor in the pisser... right after Jonsey took a fish-fueled shite."*


- [ ] Moment 3: *Finding Aeren*
	- Aeren is being kept behind a locked door somewhere in the crew quarter scrubbing floors
	- ***Challenge.***
		- Door is being guarded by a [[Dragon - Red Guard Drake]]
		- Door is padlocked: DC 17 SoH or DC 20 athletics
	- **Revelations.**
		- Geralt's parents went to the Byeshk Mountains for *something* that had to do with the Coautl
			- Clues:
				- There are rumors in ancient texts that some believed the last remaining Coautl to live in that area ([[Godlings, Demigods, and Other Mythical Creatures]])
				- Aeren had heard about Geralt's parents taking a trip out there in the past, but always thought it was more of a strange vacation
		- The Steelhardt has something to do with transferring consciousness to a new body
			- Clues:
				- The items on [[Yelena and Norbit's Grocery List]] seems unrelated, however the used lich phylactery suggests that the transfer of life is involved
				- The other items seem to be used to somehow stabilize the process, or at least prevent the undeath that accompanies lichdom


- [ ] Moment 4: *Castar's forces attack*
	- After a short time, Kazrak reports to the party that a large collection of thugs are storming the entrance from the docking point, killing the guards
	- Kazrak believes they are Castars forces, who is trying to kill Halak and consolidate power
	- Three-way fight between Halak's and Castar's forces and the party
	- ***Enemy Roster.***
		- Halak's forces: heavy hitters, big weapons
			- Frontline-offensive: Orc bloodrunners
			- 
		- Castar's forces: Magic users, potions and 'grenades'
			- Invisible ambushers: Orc Garroter (make human, remove relentless)


- [ ] Moment 5: *Finding Baelin*
	- Baelin is locked in a bathroom, and is found shaking and scared.
	- *Complication.* Baelin's right leg is broken and he can't walk
	- **Revelations**
		- The fragment is being kept in the artifact room on the upper levels, locked behind a safe
		- A warforged with a purple heart and eyes is hunting the FKD fragments
			- He attacked Baelin and his CotSF escort on their return to sharn, though was unsuccessful
			- Baelin is paranoid that he knows where Baelin is at, and that an attack is imminent.
		- The fragment is one of many, and it behaves like no other dragonshard he has ever studied before
			- He believes these FKD fragments can corrupt a life form, but only when that life form is born or dies in proximity to the fragment.
				- *Through experiments on plants and small animals*
					- Flowers wilt and have strange growths when they germinate near the shard
					- Animals are seemingly resurrected immediately after death in proximity, but display increasingly violent and unsettling behavior after.
					- The proximity to the shard doesn't matter once the life form has been corrupted.


- [ ] Moment 6: *Woe*
	- Shortly after Kazrak gives the order for the Red Cloak Battalion to move in on the HQ, he begins yelling out in confusion over the comms joined by the sounds of explosions and crashed outside
		- *"What the hell is that?!"*
		- *"Airship 3 down, airship 5 down!"*
		- *"Oh hell, get out of there! Somethings killing us! Get to the- ARRRGH!"*
	- Woe makes a dramatic entrance riding a corrupted ***Young Black Dragon ?***
	* He has developed more control over his new powers since absorbing the second FKD fragment
	* He has come looking for the 3rd
	* *Mordakhesh* gave Woe orders not to kill the party
		* However, he will drop the HQ out of the sky
	* **Appearance**
		* Woe now looks more corrupted
		* Parts of his body have taken on a purple crystalline appearance, as thought he is becoming a Khyber Dragonshard
