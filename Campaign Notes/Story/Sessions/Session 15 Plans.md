### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] Mission Brief
	- The party meets up with Kazrak before they infiltrate the Boromar HQ
	
	- **Circumstances**
		- Halak has taken the offensive against Castar. Most of Castar's safehouses have been hit, however a majority of Castar's men are unaccounted for.
		- Halak has taken total control of the HQ, however was forced to leave only a skeleton crew behind to run it due to his offensive against Castar.
		- No intel on Castar's location, and Halak is believed to be somewhere inside the HQ.
		- Red Cloak Batallion (RCB) airships and foot soldiers are posted out-of-sight and are ready to make entry once the prisoners are secured and the anti-air cannons are destroyed.
		
	- **Primary Objectives**
		1. Rescue Aaron d'Cannith and Professor Baelin ir'Torn without being detected.
		2. Take out the AA cannons on the lower and upper floors so the RCB airships can move in.
		3. Get to the rooftop and extract with the prisoners
		
	- **Secondary Objectives
		- Eliminate Halak Boromar
		- Recover any intel on safehouse locations
		
	- **Layout**
		- The HQ is constructed like a small castle with multiple floors and stairs at the corners
		- It stays constantly docked to a port that allows entry through a main gate that is under constant guard
		- The base is kept afloat via a large Eberron Dragonshard via a captured air elemental in the engine room on the lower levels.
		- *Entry*
			- *Front gate*. High difficulty due to current circumstances. Any disguise will be under heavy scrutiny.
			- *Service hatch*. A small maintenance hatch is located on the bottom level leading into the engine room. A very small prototype airship can get them close enough to crawl through.
			
	- **Threats**
		- The skeleton crew left behind to run and operate the HQ.
		- Halak Boromar and his bodyguard
		- Air defenses (cannons built into multiple floors, ballista & harpoons on the rooftop)
		
	- **Extra gear**
		- Modified Sending Stone earpieces
			- Allows the party to communicate with each other & Kazrak during the mission.
		- Feather fall coins
			- May be activated 1 time to grant the user 1 minute of "Feather Fall"
			- Disguised as Boromar Clan pendants
		- Boromar disguises
	- Key points.
		- *"Once they discover we're moving on them like this, they'll likely kill the prisoners"*
		- *"Once you rescue the prisoners we will move in."*


- [ ] Moment 1: *The Approach*
- **Approach 1: The dock**
	- Most straight-forward approach, from the dock that connects to the floating HQ.
	- "Main doors"
	- Will be a guard post to get through
	- *Challenge*
		- ID checks 
- **Approach 2: Speed ship approach**
	- More risky due to anti-air weapons
	- A smaller airship will get the party close enough to jump and attach to the walls of the HQ and infiltrate a lower level through windows
	- Kazrak will supply grapple equipment as well as window cutters.
	- *Challenge*
		- Attack rolls to test grapple points
		- Slight of hand checks to determine window-cutting speed


- [ ] Moment 2: *Clan Unrest*
	- The party hears rumblings of unrest as they explore the base
	- It is obviously undermanned and the staff/guards seem uneasy
	- Guards talk about divided loyalties
	- Party hears mention of "The professor" and "The Artificer" being separated because they were "plotting and planning"
		- *"Put the artificer to work scrubbing the crews floors"*
		- *"Locked that puny professor in the pisser... right after Jonsey took a fish-fueled shite."*


- [ ] Moment 3: *Finding Aeren*
	- Aeren is being kept behind a locked door somewhere in the crew quarter scrubbing floors
	- ***Challenge.***
		- Door is being guarded by a [[Dragon - Red Guard Drake]]
		- Door is padlocked: DC 17 SoH or DC 20 athletics
	- **Revelations.**
		- Geralt's parents went to the Byeshk Mountains for *something* that had to do with the Coautl
			- Clues:
				- There are rumors in ancient texts that some believed the last remaining Coautl to live in that area ([[Godlings, Demigods, and Other Mythical Creatures]])
				- Aeren had heard about Geralt's parents taking a trip out there in the past, but always thought it was more of a strange vacation
		- The Steelhardt has something to do with transferring consciousness to a new body
			- Clues:
				- The items on [[Yelena and Norbit's Grocery List]] seems unrelated, however the used lich phylactery suggests that the transfer of life is involved
				- The other items seem to be used to somehow stabilize the process, or at least prevent the undeath that accompanies lichdom


- [ ] Moment 4: *Castar's forces attack*
	- After a short time, Kazrak reports to the party that a large collection of thugs are storming the entrance from the docking point, killing the guards
	- Kazrak believes they are Castars forces, who is trying to kill Halak and consolidate power
	- Three-way fight between Halak's and Castar's forces and the party
	
- [ ] Encounter 1: *Three-way fight*
	- Kazrak will tell the party:
		- *"Castar's men are flooding through the main entrance!"*
		- *"We need you to take out those cannons before we can extract you"*
		- *"Protect the prisoners and get to the rooftop, that's the only way we can reach you!"*
	- ***Enemy Roster.***
		- Halak's forces: heavy hitters, big weapons
			- Frontline defenders: Orc bloodrunners
			- Backline offensives: [[Humanoid - Veteran]]
		- Castar's forces: Magic users, potions and 'grenades'
			- Invisible ambushers: Orc Garroter (make human, remove relentless)
			- Backline controllers: [[Humanoid - Alchemist]]


- [ ] Moment 5: *Finding Baelin*
	- Baelin is locked in a bathroom, and is found shaking and scared.
	- *Complication.* Baelin's right leg is broken and he can't walk
	- **Revelations**
		- The fragment is being kept in the artifact room on the upper levels, locked behind a safe
		- A warforged with a purple heart and eyes is hunting the FKD fragments
			- He attacked Baelin and his CotSF escort on their return to sharn, though was unsuccessful
			- Baelin is paranoid that he knows where Baelin is at, and that an attack is imminent.
		- The fragment is one of many, and it behaves like no other dragonshard he has ever studied before
			- He believes these FKD fragments can corrupt a life form, but only when that life form is born or dies in proximity to the fragment.
				- *Through experiments on plants and small animals*
					- Flowers wilt and have strange growths when they germinate near the shard
					- Animals are seemingly resurrected immediately after death in proximity, but display increasingly violent and unsettling behavior after.
					- The proximity to the shard doesn't matter once the life form has been corrupted.

- [ ] Moment 6: *Halak Boromar and his bodyguard*
	- Halak's bodyguard is a [[Monstrosity - Doppleganger]] that poses as Halak.
	- Halak is donned in full plate armor and is posing as the bodyguard.
	- Both are the size of halflings
	- Halak and his guard might be found on the rooftop as the party tries to leave, which will be interrupted by *Moment 7*


- [ ] Moment 7: *Woe*
	- Shortly after Kazrak gives the order for the Red Cloak Battalion to move in on the HQ, he begins yelling out in confusion over the comms joined by the sounds of explosions and crashes outside
		- *"What the hell is that?!"*
		- *"Airship 3 down, airship 5 down!"*
		- *"Oh hell, get out of there! Somethings killing us! Get to the- ARRRGH!"*
	- Woe makes a dramatic entrance riding a corrupted ***Young Black Dragon ?***
	* He has developed more control over his new powers since absorbing the second FKD fragment
	* He has come looking for the 3rd
	* *Mordakhesh* gave Woe orders not to kill the party
		* However, he will drop the HQ out of the sky
	* **Appearance**
		* Woe now looks more corrupted
		* Parts of his body have taken on a purple crystalline appearance, as thought he is becoming a Khyber Dragonshard
