- Recap Geralt's Vision
- Contest of Strength
- Discussion with Kazrak & Garhorn
- Encounter with Boromar Clan

### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] Khyber's Gate
	Contest of Strength
	* "Tucked away in Khyber’s Gate, there’s a makeshift stall run by a burly, tattooed half-orc beckoning people forward, yelling about a contest of strength. The stall looks modest at first glance, but the heavily dented training dummies standing off to the side suggests some serious martial prowess has been tested here."
	* **Grask Stonefist** runs this market stall. 
	* 11 GP buy in - 1GP for fees
	* Most damage in 1 round wins the pool.
	* *Rewards:* the pot of gold, *Gloves of missle snaring*

- [ ] Moment 1: *Meeting with Kazrak*
- **Kazrak** and the Red Cloak Battallion arrested **Garhorn** while they were pursuing the party, and he is now being held and interrogated.
- Garhorn is cooperating, and has given Kazrak very valuable intel about the Boromar Clan, including...
	- **Aaron D'Cannith** and a **Professor Baelin ir'Torn** are being held at their HQ, rumored to being forced in working on something important involving a unique fragment of a **Dragonshard.**
	- **Saidan Boromar died 2 months ago**, and his disappearance was covered up by his closest advisers.
	- His 2 best men, **Halak and Castar**, have different visions of how the clan should continue, and who should lead it.
	- Tensions have been building within the Boromar Clan, between those who follow Halak and those who follow Castar.
- Garhorn
	- Gives intel that there is a 'civil war' going on within the Clan
	- Party must stage an attack on one of the inner groups and make it look like the other did it
	- This will cause actual fighting to break out, and the HQ will be easier to infiltrate

- [ ] Moment 2: *Quest Before Infiltration (staging an attack)
- The party must choose which group to kill (Castar or Halak)
- They must then kill that group and make it look like an attack from the other group

- [ ] Encounter: *Difficult fight with multiple combatants (probably Boromar)*
- Halak
	- smuggler's den
	- Stronger combatants, less magic more brute force
	- ***Roster.***
		- [[Monstrosity - Displacer Beast|Displacer Beast]]
		- [[Humanoid - Guard|Human Guards]] (minions)
		- [[Humanoid - Orc Godcaller|Orc Godcaller]] (FM 209)
- Castar
	- Airship dock
	- More magic and less direct battle, archers/magic/traps
	- ***Roster.***
		- [[Humanoid - Cryomancer|Human Cryomancer]] (FM 164)
		- [[Dragon - White Guard Drake|White Guard Drake]]
		- [[Humanoid - Guard|Human Guards]] (minions)
		- Traps/glyph of warding
