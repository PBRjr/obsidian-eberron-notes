ToDo:

### Outline
- (List of key events or topics that will happen in the session)

### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] Khyber's Gate
- (based on where/how last session ended)

- [ ] Moment 1: *Meeting with Kazrak*
- Garhorn
	- Gives intel that there is a 'civil war' going on within the Clan
	- Party must stage an attack on one of the inner groups and make it look like the other did it
	- This will cause actual fighting to break out, and the HQ will be easier to infiltrate

- [ ] Moment 2: *Quest Before Infiltration (staging an attack)
- The party must choose which group to kill (Castar or Halak)
- They must then kill that group and make it look like an attack from the other group

- [ ] Encounter: *Difficult fight with multiple combatants (probably Boromar)*
- Halak
	- smuggler's den
	- Stronger combatants, less magic more brute force
- Castar
	- Airship dock
	- More magic and less direct battle, archers/magic/traps
