- DO KNOW: they were told to 'keep an eye' on Garhorn.
- DO NOT KNOW: Much else. Basic info about the clan.

Oak Dryfire:

- A young orc boy that provides light hearted roleplay opportunity and reveals Draven's status as a known hero.

Chewy:

- The Kobold that was covered in oil in session 2 that escaped and was captured by the gang members. Will be very scared.

_Plot Information_

- DOES KNOW: SotDoK is a fairly new group put together by Brains in an effort to create his own clan, he was always vague about their rituals, kept information to himself. Demanded a lot from the members.
