| D8                     | Encounter                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The Broken Bridge      | The party comes to a wide, fast-flowing river spanned by a rope bridge that has been sabotaged. The ropes on one side have been cut, and the bridge is impassable. The party must find a way to cross the river. Repairing the bridge will require a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Intelligence (Investigation) check and will take about an hour. Swimming across the turbulent water requires a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check, with failure resulting in being carried 50 feet downstream.     |
| Brelish Checkpoint     | The party encounters a heavily armed checkpoint manned by the Brelish Military. The soldiers are on high alert following the chaos in Sharn and are questioning everyone passing through. They will ask the party for their travel papers and their reason for traveling. A successful DC 14 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check will allow the party to pass without incident. Failure may lead to a tense standoff or combat.                                                                       |
| Exhausted Caravan      | The party finds a merchant from House Orien whose caravan is stuck. His two horses are exhausted and refuse to move. The merchant, a friendly half-elf named Elara, will offer the party 50 gp to help her get the caravan moving again. The party can help by using magic to heal the horses, by making a DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to calm and encourage them, or by helping to pull the cart themselves with a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check.                                             |
| The "Helpful" Traveler | The party meets a lone traveler, a charismatic human named Rhys, who offers to share his campfire and food. Rhys is secretly thief and is trying to lull the party into a false sense of trust. He will be friendly and helpful, offering the party some wine from his 'personal stash'. Drinking the wine will has the effect of the Sleep spell. Those that aren't affected by Sleep will instead gain 1 level of exhaustion. Rhys's goal is to steal the parties valuables while they sleep, then flee. |
| Rageblight Refugees    | The party encounters a small, desperate group of refugees fleeing the destruction of Galethspyre. They are starving and distrustful of strangers. They can share harrowing tales of the red mists and the unnatural rage that consumed their friends and neighbors. A successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check will convince them the party means no harm, and they might share what little food they have.                                                                                            |
| Abandoned Waystation   | On the side of the road is a little abandoned waystation. It offers shelter against the outdoors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
