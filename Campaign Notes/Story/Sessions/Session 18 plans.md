### Additional Notes

**Rage Mist Mechanics** (for Galethspyre only, nighttime):

- Affects emotions and judgment, not just combat ability
- Dissipates at dawn, returns at dusk

**Red Bred Robbers Theme:**

- Organized crime exploiting chaos, not mystical threat
- Groktar's bravado about "controlling rage" is empty posturing
