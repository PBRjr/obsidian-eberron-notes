### Outline
- The party begins on board a train, stuffed into crates after being smuggled out of Sharn thanks to Brother Tiron.
- The train will be forced to stop due to an obstruction in the tracks (tree or somethin).
- While stopped, the freight car is robbed by a very organized group of bandits
	- Bandits led by a (giant/orge/other big monster?)
	- The bandits have various monsters and humanoids (goblins, orcs, trolls, worgs, ogres?)
	- The bandits may bring the people in the crates back to their forward outpost between the tracks and their main camp.
- The bandits' camp is setup near the town of [[Galethspyre]], which the Rageblight recently devastated
- The bandits are opportunistic, and started moving forces into Galethspyre to take over and exploit the survivors.
- Due to the *Rageblight zone*, people in the town are more aggressive, shit is quiet here until its not. People often attack on sight, both the gang and the townsfolk.
