**IDEAS**
Whenever the party finds themselves in a Rageblight zone, hand notes to each player secretly asking them to roll a wisdom/charisma saving throw and say the number.
	- On a fail, they become more irritable. Hand out another set of notes out with something they find irritating about another player, or something that would make them angry at each other (ex.: "Draven knows something about your past that he isn't telling you" or "You think Geralt is planning to sabotage your relationship with the party")

Ultimate BBEG of the bandits
- Frost Giant Storm Hurler

### Outline
- The bandits' camp is setup near the town of [[Galethspyre]], which the Rageblight recently devastated
- The bandits are opportunistic, and started moving forces into Galethspyre to take over and exploit the survivors.
- Due to the *Rageblight zone*, people in the town are more aggressive, shit is quiet here until its not, and it gets worse at night. People often attack on sight, both the gang and the townsfolk.

### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] *On the Train*
	- The party is aboard the lightning rail, stuffed into shipping crates.
	- Allow a little time for role-play
	- Ask each party member how they're passing the time

- [ ] Moment 1: *Highway Robbery*
	- The train will be forced to stop due to an obstruction in the tracks (tree or somethin).
	- While stopped, the freight car is robbed by a very organized group of bandits (see additional notes)
		- Bandits led by a Hobgoblin Warrior dressed in rusty plate armor, with a bloody handprint across the front of the breastplate
		- The bandits employ various monsters and humanoids (goblins, giants, worgs, etc...)
		- The bandits may bring the people in the crates back to their forward outpost between the tracks and their main camp (use FOB battlemap).
- [ ] Encounter: **Highway Robbery**
- Load *Lightning Rail Robbery* encounter
- Loot:
	- Large silver key, unlocks door to monster bandit camp
	- Note: "Focus on weapons and food - we're low on supplies on the count of that fucked up town and its red fog shite. DON'T CARRY THIS NOTE ON YOU!! We don't need the authorities catching onto our location. Or worse, leading whatever destroyed that town straight to us."
	- A map leading to the main camp just west of *Galethspyre*
	- **Crate of Karrnathi Ration Steaks** Twelve vacuum‑sealed slabs of crimson meat labeled “Karrn‑Corp Nutriment, Lot KR‑1313.” They taste like iron filings and despair but count as _goodberries_ (1 hp each) once per day—if you can stomach them.
	- Cyre Memorial Wine (Pre‑Mourning, 994 YK)(200gp)
	- Set of Bound‑Elemental Manacles (hold person DC 15 on anyone shackled)
