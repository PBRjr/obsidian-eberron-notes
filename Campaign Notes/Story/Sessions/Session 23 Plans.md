### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] Session Start: Recovery after Vorak Bossfight
- **Critical:**
	- Varyn tells the party about the Silver Flame and the Mournland
	* The [[Lords of Dust]] already have multiple FKD fragments in their possesion
	* These fragments contain the fragmented essence of the Warlord of Rage and War, [[Rak Tulkesh]]
	* The LoD will attempt to free their overlord
	* This would require a sacrifice to serve as a sort of 'avatar' for his power
		* This avatar would need to be completely untainted and 'pure'
	* This would also require a massive amount of divine power, which only exists in one place: The Silver Flame itself, found in the center of the Mournland.
	* After collecting the FKD from Hrothgar, the party needs to head into the Mournland and stop the LoD from freeing Rak Tulkesh.
	* Varyn will meet them there.

- [ ] Moment 1: *The Descent*
	- During their trek down the mountain, they notice black smoke obscuring the sky
	- They soon notice that the Nameless Town below them is destroyed and on fire.
	- Familiar corpses line the ground, bloody. 
		- A small body of the child that was playing with the wooden sword can be seen outside.

- [ ] Moment 2: *Encounter with CotSF*
	* The CotSF arrives and believes the party to have destroyed the town?
