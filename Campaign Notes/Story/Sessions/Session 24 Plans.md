## LOG
* **Current Date/Time:** 7th Eyre, 998YK
* **Current Location:** Base of the Icehorn Mountains
* **Weather:** Blizzard [[weath]]
* **Active Conditions:** [[extreme-cold-xdmg|Extreme Cold]]

## STRONG START
* The party fights Bjorn's old friends at the [[Broken ropebridge]]

## SECRETS & CLUES
* Refugees from the Stormpeak Clan now hide in a cave within the Icehorn Mountains
	* This cave is protected from Hrothgar's influence because it is an ancient burial site of the Clans founders.
	* The spirits of the clan block Hrothgar's influence because he is a 'false ruler'.
* Manifest Zone: Risia
	* The [[Stormpeak Cave]] is the heart of a manifest zone for Risia, the Plain of Ice. Those who are buried here become frozen as spirits, able to protect their icy tomb for the rest of time
	* Hrothgar's influence has thinned the veil between worlds, expanding Risia's influence and causing the Great Blizzard. He has managed to harness some of this power to control elementals and people, though the cave is still protected by the spirits.

## SCENES & BEATS
* The path up the Icehorn Mountains
	* The party finds that the path is blocked by an avalanche, which magically turns around and goes back *up* the mountain towards the party
	* They find a cave nearby that goes into the mountain side.

* The Cave
	* The Clan's Spirits keep [[Plot Web#Hrothgar|Hrothgar]] from finding the people inside here
	* Many refugees from the Stormpeak Clan stay here, including [[Plot Web#PC Bjorn "Bearwolf" Ulfr|Bjorn's]] mother, Traust.
	* Traust led some of the clan here overnight after the blizzard started, Kvitrafn's spirit guiding her.

* Stormpeak Clan
	* **Vibe:** Bleak, corrupted, controlled
	* **NPC:** [[Plot Web#Hrothgar|Hrothgar]]
	* **Conflict:** Hrothgar confronts his returned borther, Bjorn, ready to put him down once and for all.
