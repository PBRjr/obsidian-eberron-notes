Moment 1: The Path
* Sitting at the start of the mountain is [[Kismet]], stoking a campfire. She offers a bit of knowledge about "The Valiant One":
	> *"Before you take this path, there is something I must warn you about. The man you seek... he is not himself anymore. Hasn't been for a long time. Every since you died (pointing at Draven)"
	> *"He sits up there, in his cabin at the peak, all alone. He is haunted by his failures. His failures of Loyalty, of Power, and of Legacy."*
	> *"The Valiant One is broken, and the pieces of him lay in that town. Talk to the Nameless. Learn of his life, of his failures. Gather his pieces. And only when you are ready, continue up this path.
	> When you finally meet Varyn, please, be gentle. Do not demand answers; listen to his pain. Offer him redemption. He must be shown that, after all this time, and despite his failures, he is still worth his name."*

* The path is roughly maintained and carved into the mountain. 5 stone pillars jut out of the mountain at various points along the path, each detailing one of [[The 4 Vows]] that [[Clan Flameforge]] used to represent. 

* The final pillar is destroyed, but used to display a carving of [[Kismet]], who was the Couatl that was meant to stay behind.

- [ ] Moment 1a: The Sanctum of the Broken Wing
- Once the location of great prayers crafted at the hands of Clan Flameforge, it is now a ruin, a place of reverence for those of the Nameless that take the Pilgrimage up the Path.
- This is the location for the [[Vorak Bossfight]]

* [ ] Moment 2: The Cabin and The Broken One
	* Varyn takes the form of a frail old man. He refuses to believe the party is real, thinking them hallucinations of his failures.
	
	* **[[Trial of Ghosts]]**
	
	* Once convinced, he reveals certain **plot threads:**
		1. **The Mistake:** He explains that he alerted the _Lords of Dust_ to the shards by looking for them.
		2. **Hrothgar’s Curse:** He confirms that **Bjorn’s brother** is possessed by the shard's influence and wields the **Etherseraph** (the key to the Mourning/Silver Flame).
		3. **Draven’s Purpose:** He reveals he saved Draven but couldn't restore his memories. He confirms Draven’s purpose is to be a vessel of _Siberys_ light to counter the _Khyber_ darkness.
		4. **Forge’s Nature (Optional but cool):** As a creature of Siberys, Varyn might look at **Forge** and sense the "Perfect Balance" (Siberys conduit/Khyber soul taint) which makes Forge unique, hinting at the _Steelhardt_ secret without giving the technical schematic.

- [ ] Moment 3: The Legacy of Steel
- Varyn notices **Geralt's** schematic page (or Geralt shows it).
- **The Translation:** Varyn recognizes the language as **Sibernyan** (Draconic dialect of the Couatl). He reads it for Geralt.
    - _Content:_ The page details the **"Triad of Soul"**—how to balance Siberys (Spirit), Khyber (Passion), and Eberron (Body)
    - Geralt has the spirit and the body, but not the passion. To achieve proper balance within himself, he must die in the presence of an FKD.
    - Varyn offers his powers of resurrection in this.
   - _The Effect:_ Understanding this allows Geralt to mechanically **Unlock the Legacy Stone**. It is a containment unit.
*  **Forge's Nature:** Varyn looks at Forge with sadness/fascination. He is the balance Geralt's parents needed, but it happened to him by complete accident.

- [ ] Moment 4: The Hunt for Vorak (The Mission)
- Varyn sets the path forward.
- **The Problem:** Hrothgar holds a physical Dragonshard. If they use the untested Legacy Stone on him, the feedback could detonate the shard and wipe out the region (or kill the user).
- **The Solution:** They must hunt **Vorak** first.
    - Vorak is a "leaking vessel" (Quasi-Lich).
    - **Objective:** Use the Legacy Stone to absorb Vorak's corruption. This will (1) remove Vorak as a threat and (2) charge/calibrate the Stone so it is strong enough to sever Hrothgar's connection to the Dragonshard.

- [ ] Session end: Rageblight
	- The Rageblight darkens the sky in red mist...
