### Moments & Encounters

* [ ] Session Start: Giant Ambush
* While traveling towards the mountains, two stone giants ambush the party.
* **Context:** These giants were once **Red Hands** enforcers, but they look wrong. Their skin is cracked, glowing with magma-like energy veins. They are infected with **Rageblight**.
* **Roster.**
	* [[marble-stone-giant-fleemortals|Marble Stone Giant]] (Corrupted, deals & takes +2d8 force damage on hit, 100hp, fights recklessly)
	* [[granite-stone-giant-fleemortals|Granite Stone Giant]] (Corrupted: Deals +1d6 psychic damage on hit, 90hp)

* [ ] Moment 1: [[The Nameless Town at the Base of the Mountain]]
* This small town lost its name long ago. 
* The population is made up of former worshipers of [[Clan Flameforge]] that lost their way years ago when the Clan was broken up.
* **Draven's Return:** The elders recognize [[The Party#Draven Flameforge|Draven]]. He is a legend here ("The Knight of the North").
    - _Reaction:_ A mixture of religious awe and fear. Some thought he was dead; his return is viewed as an omen.
* They undergo pilgrimages up the treacherous mountain path in order to meet and offer sacrifice to "[[Varyn|The Valiant One]]"

* [ ] Moment 2: The Path
* Somewhere up the mountain path sits [[Kismet]], stoking a campfire. She offers a bit of knowledge about "The Valiant One"
	> *"The Valiant One is broken. He sees ghosts in the snow. Do not demand answers; listen to his pain. Offer him redemption."*
* The path is roughly maintained and carved into the mountain. Several stone pillars jut out of the mountain at various points along the path, each detailing a part of [[The Great Sacrifice]]
* The final pillar is destroyed, but used to display a carving of [[Kismet]], who was the Couatl that was meant to stay behind.

* [ ] Moment 3: The Cabin and The Broken One
	* Varyn takes the form of a frail old man. He refuses to believe the party is real, thinking them hallucinations of his failures.
	
	* **Social Challenge.** Varyn must be convinced that the party is real.
		* Definite ways:
			* ???
	
	* **Varyn's Failures:**
		* Too cowardly to join in the Couatl's sacrifice
		* Tipped off [[Mordakesh]] & the LoD to the [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]]'s existence
		* Allowed Hrothgar's soul to be tainted by a FKD fragment
		* Failed to hold Clan Flameforge together
		* Trained Draven Flameforge, leading to his demise at the hands of Hrothgar
		* Revived Draven, but wasn't strong enough to give him his memories back
	
	* Once convinced, he reveals certain **plot threads:**
		1. 1. **The Mistake:** He explains that he alerted the _Lords of Dust_ to the shards by looking for them.
		2. **Hrothgar’s Curse:** He confirms that **Bjorn’s brother** is possessed by the shard's influence and wields the **Etherseraph** (the key to the Mourning/Silver Flame).
		3. **Draven’s Purpose:** He reveals he saved Draven but couldn't restore his memories. He confirms Draven’s purpose is to be a vessel of _Siberys_ light to counter the _Khyber_ darkness.
		4. **Forge’s Nature (Optional but cool):** As a creature of Siberys, Varyn might look at **Forge** and sense the "Perfect Balance" (Siberys conduit/Khyber soul taint) which makes Forge unique, hinting at the _Steelhardt_ secret without giving the technical schematic.

- [ ] Moment 4: The Legacy of Steel
- Varyn notices **Geralt's** schematic page (or Geralt shows it).
- **The Translation:** Varyn recognizes the language as **Sibernyan** (Draconic dialect of the Couatl). He reads it for Geralt.
    - _Content:_ The page details the **"Triad of Soul"**—how to balance Siberys (Spirit), Khyber (Passion), and Eberron (Body).
    - Geralt has the spirit and the body, but not the passion. To achieve proper balance within himself, he must die in the presence of an FKD.
    - Varyn offers his powers of resurrection in this.
   - _The Effect:_ Understanding this allows Geralt to mechanically **Unlock the Legacy Stone**. It is a containment unit.
*  **Forge's Nature:** Varyn looks at Forge with sadness/fascination. He is the balance Geralt's parents needed, but it happened to him by complete accident.

- [ ] Moment 5: The Hunt for Vorak (The Mission)
- Varyn sets the path forward.
- **The Problem:** Hrothgar holds a physical Dragonshard. If they use the untested Legacy Stone on him, the feedback could detonate the shard and wipe out the region (or kill the user).
- **The Solution:** They must hunt **Vorak** first.
    - Vorak is a "leaking vessel" (Quasi-Lich).
    - **Objective:** Use the Legacy Stone to absorb Vorak's corruption. This will (1) remove Vorak as a threat and (2) charge/calibrate the Stone so it is strong enough to sever Hrothgar's connection to the Dragonshard.

- [ ] Session end: Rageblight
	- The Rageblight darkens the sky in red mist...
	- [[Vorak Bossfight]]
