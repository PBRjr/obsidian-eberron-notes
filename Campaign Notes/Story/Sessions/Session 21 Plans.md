### Moments & Encounters

* [ ] Session Start: Giant Ambush
* While traveling towards the mountains, two stone giants ambush the party, and are looking to make them their dinner!
* **Roster.**
	* [[marble-stone-giant-fleemortals|Marble Stone Giant]] (Appears chipped and damaged. Only has 70hp due to past battles)
	* [[granite-stone-giant-fleemortals|Granite Stone Giant]] (Appears chipped and damaged. Only has 90hp due to past battles)

* [ ] Moment 1: [[The Nameless Town at the Base of the Mountain]]
* This small town lost its name long ago. 
* The population is made up of former worshipers of [[Clan Flameforge]] that lost their way years ago when the Clan was broken up.
* The people are are weary of outsiders, though many will still offer help in the name of the Couatl.
* They undergo pilgrimages up the treacherous mountain path in order to meet and offer sacrifice to "[[Varyn|The Valiant One]]"

* [ ] Moment 2: The Path
* Somewhere up the mountain path sits [[Kismet]], stoking a campfire. She offers a bit of knowledge about "The Valiant One"
	* The man you seek... he's not the same man he used to be.
	* Be gentle with him, and please, be patient. He's been through more than you could imagine.
	* He lost everything... and the shock of seeing you, well, I just hope its not too much for him.
* The path is roughly maintained and carved into the mountain. Several stone pillars jut out of the mountain at various points along the path, each detailing some part of Varyn's or the Couatl's history.

* [ ] Moment 3: The Cabin and The Broken One
	* He spends his days in his cabin, sad and defeated. 
	* He's researched ways to kill a couatl in the past, in an effort to end his own life?
	* He is relieved and astonished to see Draven alive, but soon after realizes that Draven and Bjorn are only more reminders to his past failures.
	* **Varyn's Failures:**
		* Too cowardly to join in the Couatl's sacrifice
		* Tipped off [[Mordakesh]] & the LoD to the [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]]'s existence
		* Allowed Hrothgar's soul to be tainted by a FKD fragment
		* Failed to hold Clan Flameforge together
		* Trained Draven Flameforge, leading to his demise at the hands of Hrothgar
		* Revived Draven, but wasn't strong enough to give him his memories back
