## Sigs
- Marsh is kept inside the cave, mistaken as a 'dragonkin' to be used in a ritual.
- '**The Brains**' - a [[Statblocks#Kobold Scale Sorcerer|kobold scale sorcerer]] that is intelligent *for a kobold* and is the one that made the deal with Woe to help him take down the [[The Airship|Merkentile]]
- This is a faction of Kobolds that worship [[Tiamat]], called the [[Sons of the Daughter of Khyber]]

## In the cave
- Find familiar bodies (**Karnathi Soldiers**, **Orcish Bartender**)
- Traps
- Loot
- Torture devices and corpses
- top level + sublevel
	- Top: main chamber, disposal/trapped corridor and room, Brain's chamber
	- Sublevel: disposal corridor, leading to outside grate. Zombies? Cube?

## Enemy goals
- Want to summon [[Argonnessen#Secrets|The Daughter of Khyber]] by doing a ritual sacrifice of a "**Willing Dragon Kin**".
	- They misinterpreted this as any Dragonborn/Kobolds, not a willing dragon that has to sacrifice itself.
- This sacrifice is a mistaken ancient take on a part of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] that states if a willing dragon kin is sacrificed in a very particular set of circumstances, The Daughter of Khyber will be freed.

## Treasure
- [[Brains to Woe| Half-written letter]] from Brains to [[Woe]]
- Wand of magic detection (next to a shackled skeleton with no hands)
	- Glows when its near a magic source (always glowing cause it is a magic source)
- Rock of perpetual existing?
- Ring of cold resistance (on the finger of a charred corpse)
- Several potions of healing (on various surfaces next to tortured victims)
- Around 100gp *total*
- Scroll of magic missile

## Marsh
- [[Jonston Marsh]]
- Caged in the sublevel, unconscious
- Clothes stripped, in a pile next to him

## Next
- [[Shavalant]]
- [[Journey to the City of Towers]]
