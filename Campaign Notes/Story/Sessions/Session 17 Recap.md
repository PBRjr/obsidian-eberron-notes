Ambushed the bandits after the train left
- Train stopped due to the bandits distraction
- bandits entered the freight car the party was in and started to loot boxes
- The party fought the bandits and got off the train
- The party defeated the bandits, leaving no surviviors
	- In this bandit party:
		- Thog, Gog, Thogog - goblins riding worgs
		- Bandito Muselhar - Hobgoblin leader of the small robbery group (not the leader of all the bandits)
		- Nail - Hill Giant enforcer (the group's muscle)
- forgot about Baelin & Aeren - left them on the train which resumed its trip toward Wroat
- Loot:
	- Key, map to the bandit camp & Galethsypre, note found on bandit, 12 goodberry steaks, 2 cyrian memorial wines (200gp)
- Geralt wants to switch to cleric - make it related to unlocking the legacy stone?
	- Maybe when the stone fully unlocks it transitions Geralt into a cleric with a focus on nautre
	- Due to the new power granted by his mother's consciousness? 
	- Needs refinement
- Party leveled to 7

Going to either go to Wroat to find Aeren & Baelin OR go to Galthspyre to investigate
* Need to develop both options
* Wroat:
	* What does the city feel like? What quests will the party encounter?
	* Need to better understand the main theme of the city - what central tension plagues the city when the party arrives? This will define the feeling the players get when they enter.
* Galethspyre & the bandit camp
	* Refine the bandit group - who are they? Pesonality, theme
	* Traditional mafia gangers - could be fun, easy to roleplay, fun twist (traditionally violent monsters acting in a well-organized Italian mob)
	* Galethspyre - Destroyed town, probably a few weeks ago
		* Red mist permeates the outside of the town at night, the inside of broken buildings the only safe place.
		* Any creature caught in the mists at night become fueled by rage, attacking anything in sight
