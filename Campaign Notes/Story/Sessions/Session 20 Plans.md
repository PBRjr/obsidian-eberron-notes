### Outline
The party speaks with Hank, who may brag about the new Fire Bikes he has been given.
The party may choose to take those bikes to get to the Byeshk Mountains.
They could also travel to the Red Hand's Camp and get Kynes to make Geralt a temporary potion.

### Moments & Encounters

	- A guard accidently trips the alarm to the garage while the party is speaking with Hank.

- [x] Encounter: *Grand Theft Magitech*
- The party attempts to steal the motorcycles from the garage.
- **Location:** A garage close to the tavern, cluttered with tools and storage. A tripwire alarm (DC 15 Perception/Thieves' Tools) is set up near the main door and side door.

* [ ] Encounter 2: Giant Ambush
* While traveling towards the mountains, two stone giants ambush the party, and are looking to make them their dinner!

	* [[granite-stone-giant-fleemortals|Granite Stone Giant]] (Appears chipped and damaged. Only has 90hp due to past battles)

* [ ] Moment 3: The Nameless Town at the Base of the Mountain
* This small town lost its name long ago. 
* The population is made up of former worshipers of Clan Flameforge that lost their way years ago when the Clan was broken up.
* The people are are weary of outsiders, though many will still offer help in the name of the Couatl.
* They undergo pilgrimages up the treacherous mountain path in order to meet and offer sacrifice to "The Valiant One"

* [ ] Moment 4: The Path
* Somewhere up the mountain path sits Kismet, stoking a campfire. She offers a bit of knowledge about "The Valiant One"
	* The man you seek... he's not the same man he used to be.
	* Be gentle with him, and please, be patient. He's been through more than you could imagine.
	* He lost everything... and the shock of seeing you, well, I just hope its not too much for him.

- [ ] Moment 5: _The Red Hands' Camp
	- If the party follows tracks from the tavern or information from Bernard, they can find the main bandit camp in the nearby **Old Thane's Mine**.
	- **The Brothers Giant:** The camp is run by **Garspaachi** (frost giant) and **Bruno** (fire giant), who act like surprisingly civil mob bosses. They have Kynes Lawford treating their wounded.
	- **Negotiation:** The giants are business-minded. They left their old home because of Hrothgar's corruption and are looking for work. They might release Kynes for a price (money, a magic item, information) or a favor. [[Favors]]
		> **Garspaachi:** 
		> "So, you're the ones stirrin' up my boys. Bad for business."
		> **Bruno:** *unintelligible retard sounds and bursts of flame*
	- They can offer Bjorn information about Hrothgar and the corrupted land near the Stormpeak Clan.
