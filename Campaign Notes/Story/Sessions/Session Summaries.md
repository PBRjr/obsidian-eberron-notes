- Killed Orc 1 and Orc 3 during the encounter.
- They healed and interrogated the captured Kobold, who told them that the Sons of the Daughter of Khyber were a very make-shift and disorganized cult. He also told them Brains struck a deal with Woe to take down the airship in session 1 so they could get more people to sacrifice, though he didn't know Woe's name.
	- The party let the kobold escape.
- Let Garhorn and his blink dog Flicker leave alive, along with one of their horses (the one that demanded carrots from Geralt when he used speak with animals).
	- The party did not search Garhorn, he left with his sending stone and special lockpicking set.
	- Garhorn will travel to the closest known Boromar safe house and get aid. He used his sending stone to contact his superior and order a hit out on the party. He will also return to Shavalant with more gang members and burn the town to the ground since they aided the party.
	- PCs took the remaining horse from camp (the one that was very thankful for the apple Geralt fed it).

The party returned to Shavalant soon after, and went to talk to Miri.
- The townsfolk they passed were quite startled by the party and their appearence due to their recent fight with the gang members.
- Miri was concerned at how they handled it, though she was grateful they helped at all.
	- She is afraid that Garhorn will send for more muscle and come back to burn the town to the ground.
	- She relays to the party that she spoke with her mentor Aeren d'Cannith, and that he needs the names of the party so he can aid them through the Sharn gates once they arrive.
	- Miri also told the PCs that he was intrigued about Geralt's steelhardt schematics, though he wouldn't reveal anything over sending stone.
	- (Aeren will recognize Geralt's last name and will begin looking into his family further, suspecting they are connected to House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning.)
- Sheriff Cromley showed up at Miri's workshop during this conversation, very irate. He asked the party to leave, and payed for another horse they could ride out of town.
	- He is concered for the same reasons Miri is, though he is less grateful towards the party than her.
- The PCs stopped by Prissy's apothecary on the way out, and she gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth as thanks for delivering news of her son's passing (which happened in session 1).
- They read the intel letter concernig Baelen and his group of CotSF guards and planned on heading to Sharn, with a possible detour to Castle Arakhain (AKA "The Lighthouse") to investigate a potential lead on the purple crystal he has, hoping to discover more about Woe.

- They used him as a prisoner for their disguises as they continued searaching the place for Baelin ir'Torn

They went to the artifact room and collected some loot

- Party leveled to 7

Going to either go to Wroat to find Aeren & Baelin OR go to Galthspyre to investigate
* Need to develop both options
* Wroat:
	* What does the city feel like? What quests will the party encounter?
	* Need to better understand the main theme of the city - what central tension plagues the city when the party arrives? This will define the feeling the players get when they enter.
* Galethspyre & the bandit camp
	* Refine the bandit group - who are they? Pesonality, theme
	* Traditional mafia gangers - could be fun, easy to roleplay, fun twist (traditionally violent monsters acting in a well-organized Italian mob)
	* Galethspyre - Destroyed town, probably a few weeks ago
		* Red mist permeates the outside of the town at night, the inside of broken buildings the only safe place.

## Session 19 Recap

### Attendance

| Players | Attendance |
| ------- | ---------- |
| Bjorn   | n          |
| Draven  | y          |
| Forge   | n          |
| Geralt  | y          |
| Lox     | y          |
| Nyx     | y          |
**How were the PC's handled for those not in attendance?**
Bjorn faded into the background. Forge went off with Aeren and Baelin to safely escort them to Shavalant.

### Loot Obtained
* Bjorn: +1 Greataxe
* Draven: +1 Plate armor
* Nyx: Scepter

### To-do for next session
* Need to have an answer ready for if Forge has a crystal in him like the one Geralt has.
* Figure out how to take back the railroading of the party not having enough time to make it to the mountains.
	* Maybe Hank tells them of a path they can take to get there, but will only reach it if the forgo rest for a few nights.
	* Or I could just tell them that as the DM.
	* I feel bad for railroading them into the town quests.
	* How will Varyn cure Geralt?
		* He will show them how to perform the Legacy Stone ritual that will later be used on Vorak. This ritual free's the consciousness from the crystal, giving it ghostly body. It gains power, and becomes aggressive.

### Events of the session summarized:
Interrogated Korvin Thale
* Learned that the FKD fragments contain the consciousness of Rak Tulkesh
* Geralt asked Korvin about Varyn, who didn't know who that is
* Draven had a memory of training with Varyn as a young boy with wooden swords
* Lox has the crazy idea of forcing one of the CotSF higher-ups take over his pact for him\
	* I don't think he will pursue this route
* They let Korven Thale go with the understanding that the church will still pursue the party, and that Korven will continue to follow his orders.
	* The party said they would think about giving the FKD over to the church but made no promises.

Lox had his Kismet reading and had flashbacks to meeting Nyx, having their kid, and his meetings with his patron

Aeren & Baelin told the party that they were going to travel to Shavalant to meet back up with Miri and form a new base of operations there. They will take Piston with them as well.
* They were concerned for their own safety should they continue to travel with the party.
* The party asked Aeren to create a combat-focused robot similar to piston for them when he arrives at Shavalant.
	* The party wants it named "Delamane"
	* Aeren happily agreed to it, and said he would begin work on it as soon as he arrived.
	* Forge is going to travel with Aeren & Baelin to make sure they arrive safely. He took a horse with them.

* Hank told the party they are welcome to stay in the Broken Mast Tavern tonight and speak to Hank in more detail of the events that transpired in the town.

* See To-do
