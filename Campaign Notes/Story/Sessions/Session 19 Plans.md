### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] Session Start: _Aftermath of the Purge_
	- The party must decide what to do with their captive, **Inquisitor Korven Thale**. He is fanatically loyal to the Silver Flame but is also a pragmatist. He can reveal the Church's motivations: they believe the FKD fragments are a prison for an Overlord. Which overlord is lost to history, but either way they are too dangerous to be left unaccounted for.
		- Baelin's initial research revealed they can have a corrupting effect in specific circumstances
		- The warforged ([[Woe]]) has made several attempts at collecting their FKD while they were protecting Baelin.
		- If the fragments are reunited within a pure avatar, the Overlord will be unleashed.
			- *Foreshadowing:* Elix is the pure sacrifice that Mordakhesh intends to unleash Rak Tulkesh within.
	- **Loot:**
		- [[Scepter of Madness|Inquisitor Thale's Scepter of Madness]]
		- Thorin Voss's armor (*+1 Plate Armor*)
		- 450 gp from the squad members.

- [ ] **Moment 1: _The Road to Galethspyre_**
	- As the party travels, the environment becomes more unsettling.
	- **Environmental Clues:** They find abandoned refugee camps and warning totems made of bone and red cloth. A mile marker for Galethspyre has been defaced with "THE FOG COMES AT NIGHT" and "FEAR THE BROTHERS GIANT."
	- **NPC Encounter:** In a roadside camp the party finds **Marta Vex**, the former Watch Captain of Galethspyre. She is armed but starving and distrustful.
		> "It was like a storm, but it wasn't... it was a creature. A single, hulking thing of pure rage. And after it was done, the thing just turned to mist and disappeared"
		> "It didn't just destroy our town, it filled it with its own madness."
		> At night, the mist... it's his anger, and it makes good people turn on each other."

- [ ] **Moment 2: _Arrival in Galethspyre_**
	- The town is eerily quiet during the day. A few members of the **Red Hands Gang** are looting the ruins. They don't seek trouble, just keep an eye on the party.
	- People can be seen darting into homes.

- [ ] Moment 2a: Public Trial
	- A public "trial" is being held by the leader of the town, *[[Chef Nyla]]*. 
		- She is prosecuting the town baker, *Jakob*, for baking a batch of bread that made people sick. She gives out lashings.
		- A Human Bookkeeper, *[[Hank]]*, is seen by her side during the trial, ushering her on.
			- He is the bookkeeper for the Red Hand's Gang, and is running operations in Galethspyre
	
- [ ] **Moment 3: _Exploring the Blight_**
	- **Gilded Grass Apothecary:** Inside the ransacked building sits a frantic and terrified [[Bernard McOogle]]. He explains that his mentor, [[Kynes Lawford]], was taken by the Red Hands Gang. He pleads with the party to rescue him, as Kynes is the only one who can help Geralt.

	- **The Broken Mast Tavern:** Now a forward base for the Red Hands Gang. The party may overhear bandits complaining about the "rage mist" at night and their giant leaders.

	- **The Tunnels:** Where the surviving members of the town reside at night.
		- Leader: [[Chef Nyla]]
		- Primary problem: Low on supplies, which are hoarded in the Broken Mast Tavern by the Red Hands Gang. Can give party a map with entrances to the tavern.
		- Secondary Problem: Healer Kynes Lawford was kidnapped. Speak to Bernard McOogle

	- **Town Hall:** The first building hit by the Rageblight. Death and decay overlays the floor here.
	- **The Statue:** A destroyed statue of "The Thane" sits in the middle of the town, splintered and destroyed, with a massive path of destruction leading into the north west part of town. A DC 14 Investigation check reveals the damage was caused by a single, powerful entity, not an army or natural disaster.

- [ ] **Moment 4: _The Red Hands' Camp_**
	- If the party follows tracks from the tavern or information from Bernard, they can find the main bandit camp in the nearby **Old Thane's Mine**.
	- **The Brothers Giant:** The camp is run by **Garspaachi** (frost giant) and **Bruno** (fire giant), who act like surprisingly civil mob bosses. They have Kynes Lawford treating their wounded.
	- **Negotiation:** The giants are business-minded. They left their old home because of Hrothgar's corruption and are looking for work. They might release Kynes for a price (money, a magic item, information) or a favor. [[Favors]]
		> **Garspaachi:** 
		> "So, you're the ones stirrin' up my boys. Bad for business."
		> **Bruno:** *unintelligible retard sounds and bursts of flame*
	- They can offer Bjorn information about Hrothgar and the corrupted land near the Stormpeak Clan.

- [ ] **Session End: _The Red Mist Rises_**
	- As dusk falls, a crimson mist seeps from the ground, filling the streets. The cries of enraged survivors and bandits echo through the ruins.
	- Any creature exposed to the mist must make a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** at the start of their turn. On a failure, they are overcome with rage for 1 minute, gaining advantage on melee attack rolls but having disadvantage on all ability checks. They must attack the nearest creature.

### Location Details

Place 1: _Galethspyre_
- A small fishing village devastated by the Rageblight a few weeks ago. Buildings are collapsing, and a sense of dread hangs in the air.
- **Key Locations:**
	- *The Gilded Gill Apothecary:* A two-story building, mostly intact but ransacked. 
	- *The Broken Mast Tavern:* Now a makeshift base for the Red Hands Gang.
	- *Town Hall:* Contains records of the town's slow descent into madness before its fall.

### People

Person 1: *Korven Thale*
*Session Information*
- Captured by the party. He is a zealot but not suicidal. He can be interrogated for information on the Church's knowledge of the FKD and their fear of the Lords of Dust.
*Plot Information*
- His capture is a significant blow to the Church's local operations. His superiors will not be pleased and may escalate their methods to retrieve the FKD fragment.

Person 2: *Kynes Lawford*
*Session Information*
- A skilled but eccentric healer who is the party's only hope of saving Geralt. He is more interested in rare herbs than politics or danger.
*Plot Information*
- He is unaffiliated with any major faction but his skills are rare and valuable, making him a person of interest to many.

Person 3: *Marta Vex*
*Session Information*
- The sole surviving authority figure from Galethspyre. Traumatized but resilient, she can offer tactical information about the town layout, survivor locations, and bandit patrols.
*Plot Information*
- She witnessed the Rageblight's arrival and can describe a large, monstrous figure leading the attack, providing a clue about Vorak's nature.

### Plot Actions

Action 1: *Vorak's Influence (The Rageblight)*
- Goal: N/A (passive effect)
- The Rageblight zone around Galethspyre acts as a constant environmental threat. The red mist at night will turn the town into a free-for-all warzone, making simple tasks incredibly dangerous and complicating any fight the party gets into.
