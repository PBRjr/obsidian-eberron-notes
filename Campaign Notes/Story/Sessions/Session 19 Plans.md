### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] Session Start: _Aftermath of the Purge_
	- The party must decide what to do with their captive, **Inquisitor Korven Thale**. He is fanatically loyal to the Silver Flame but is also a pragmatist. He can reveal the Church's motivations: they believe the FKD fragments are corrupting anchors for Khyber and are too dangerous to exist.
	- **Loot:**
		- Inquisitor Thale's scepter (+1 light mace, casts *Cause Fear* 1/day)
		- Thorin Voss's armor (+1 Plate Armor)
		- 450 gp from the squad members.

- [ ] Moment 1: _Approaching Galethspyre_
	- As the party gets closer to the town, the environment becomes unsettling.
	- **Environmental Clues:** They find abandoned refugee camps, warning totems made of bone and red cloth, and roads defaced with crude warnings like "FEAR THE BROTHERS GIANT."
	- **NPC Encounter:** They can meet **Marta Vex**, the traumatized former Watch Captain of Galethspyre, hiding in some ruins. She can provide information about the "Red Mist" that descends at night, the madness it causes, and the "Red Hands" bandits who have moved in.

- [ ] Encounter 1: _Galethspyre's Welcome_
	- The town is in ruins and eerily quiet during the day. The party will be watched by both hidden survivors and bandit lookouts.
	- As they search for the apothecary, they might be ambushed by a patrol of the **Red Hands Gang**.
	- ***Enemy Roster.***
		- [[Humanoid - Bugbear]] x2
		- [[Beast - Worg]] x2
		- [[Humanoid - Goblin Boss]] x1 (Scout leader)

- [ ] Moment 2: *Bernard McOogle*
	- Bernard is hold up in Galethspyre after he traveled here with his mentor Kynes Lawford to pick up supplies and offer services.
	- Kynes was taken by the Red Hands Gang for his value as a powerful healer.\

- [ ] Session End: _The Red Mist Rises_
	- The party finds the apothecary and retrieves the Ghost Spores.
	- As dusk falls, a faint, crimson mist begins to seep from the ground, filling the streets.
	- All living creatures (including PCs) who are exposed to the mist must make a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** at the beginning of each turn or be affected by a rage that gives them advantage on melee attack rolls but disadvantage on all ability checks and ranged attack rolls. The effect lasts as long as they are in the mist.
	- The session can end with the party trapped in the apothecary as enraged townsfolk and bandits begin to scream and fight in the streets outside.

### Location Details

Place 1: _Galethspyre_
- A small fishing village devastated by the Rageblight a few weeks ago. Buildings are collapsing, and a sense of dread hangs in the air.
- **Key Locations:**

	- *The Broken Mast Tavern:* Now a makeshift base for the Red Hands Gang.

### People

Person 1: *Korven Thale*
*Session Information*
- Captured by the party. He is a zealot but not suicidal. He can be interrogated for information on the Church's knowledge of the FKD and their fear of the Lords of Dust.
*Plot Information*
- His capture is a significant blow to the Church's local operations. His superiors will not be pleased and may escalate their methods to retrieve the FKD fragment.

Person 2: *Kynes Lawford*
*Session Information*
- A skilled but eccentric healer who is the party's only hope of saving Geralt. He is more interested in rare herbs than politics or danger.
*Plot Information*
- He is unaffiliated with any major faction but his skills are rare and valuable, making him a person of interest to many.

Person 3: *Marta Vex*
*Session Information*
- The sole surviving authority figure from Galethspyre. Traumatized but resilient, she can offer tactical information about the town layout, survivor locations, and bandit patrols.
*Plot Information*
- She witnessed the Rageblight's arrival and can describe a large, monstrous figure leading the attack, providing a clue about Vorak's nature.

### Plot Actions

Action 1: *Red Hands Gang*
- Goal: Solidify control over Galethspyre and exploit its remaining resources and survivors.
- The gang is fortifying positions within the town and actively hunting down the few remaining townsfolk hiding in the ruins. The party's arrival is an unwelcome complication.

Action 2: *Vorak's Influence (The Rageblight)*
- Goal: N/A (passive effect)
- The Rageblight zone around Galethspyre acts as a constant environmental threat. The red mist at night will turn the town into a free-for-all warzone, making simple tasks incredibly dangerous and complicating any fight the party gets into.
