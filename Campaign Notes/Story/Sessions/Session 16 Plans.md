- [x] Encounter 1: *Cannith search party*
	- *If Forge's player is present, this might take place at Aeren's workshop*
	- A group of thugs sent by House Cannith has been tracking the party since they broke into the [[Wolfsbane Workshop]] and is looking for Forge and Geralt.
	- They want Forge due to his backstory as a Cannith creation and his knowledge of the Creation Forges
	- They want Geralt due to the schematics he holds

		- She can be found frequenting *Marquet's Meat Market* in her free time

	- She was one of the few that left the clan shortly after Bjorn was usurped, and before Hrothgar could gain power over them. 
	- *Exposition.*
		- The old way to the Mountains has been sealed by Hrothgar, isolating the clan from the outside world.

- [ ] Session End: *Train Robbery*
	- A group of low-level bandits created an ambush point at a bend in the rail with an obstacle (tree)
	- They board the freight car while the train is stopped, in hopes of robbing a few pieces of cargo.
	- These bandits are from the remaining survivors of a small town that the *Rageblight* devastated.

### People

Person 1: *Aeren d'Cannith*
*Session Information*
- Geralt's parents went to the Byeshk Mountains for *something* that had to do with the Coautl
	- Clues:
		- There are rumors in ancient texts that some believed the last remaining Coautl to live in that area ([[Godlings, Demigods, and Other Mythical Creatures]])
		- Aeren had heard about Geralt's parents taking a trip out there in the past, but always thought it was more of a strange vacation
- The Steelhardt has something to do with transferring consciousness to a new body
	- Clues:
		- The items on [[Yelena and Norbit's Grocery List]] seems unrelated, however the used lich phylactery suggests that the transfer of life is involved
		- The other items seem to be used to somehow stabilize the process, or at least prevent the undeath that accompanies lichdom

Person 2: *Baelin ir'Torn*
*Session Information*
- The fragment is being kept in the artifact room on the upper levels, locked behind a safe
- A warforged with a purple heart and eyes is hunting the FKD fragments
	- He attacked Baelin and his CotSF escort on their return to sharn, though was unsuccessful
	- Baelin is paranoid that he knows where Baelin is at, and that an attack is imminent.
- The fragment is one of many, and it behaves like no other dragonshard he has ever studied before
	- He believes these FKD fragments can corrupt a life form, but only when that life form is born or dies in proximity to the fragment.
		- *Through [[Research Notes on Proximity Tests 7-10|experiments]] on plants and small animals*
			- Flowers wilt and have strange growths when they germinate near the shard
			- Animals that are resurrected immediately after death in proximity, but display increasingly violent and unsettling behavior after.
			- The proximity to the shard doesn't matter once the life form has been corrupted.
	- Khyber crystals usually contain some type of entity - demons, devils, or similar.

Person 3: *Brother Tiron*
*Session Information*
- Brother Tiron is a lowly friar in the CotSF who makes coin on the side as a smuggler
	- He has smuggled illegal ingredients and parts for Aeren d'Cannith in the past
	- He is willing to smuggle the party out of the city for a price
		- He will smuggle them through... the sewers? by lightning rail? Some way that will create another encounter?
- He can be found in *Trader's Bridge* in *Middle Tarvick's Market*

### Plot Actions

Action 1: *Woe is seeking the FKD fragment and will search the wreckage of the HQ*
- Goal: Recover the FKD fragment
- Search the wreckage of the Boromar HQ to find the fragment. He was ordered not to directly harm the party by Mordakhesh.
