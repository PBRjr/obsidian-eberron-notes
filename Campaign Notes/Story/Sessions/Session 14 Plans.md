TODO:
* The party may want to return to the airship, leave clues and develop Shavalant
* Kismet is going to cause hallucinations to Nyx - Rework Kismet's backstory and why she would give Nyx hallucinations of her daughter.
### Outline
- The party is visited by the Church of the Silver Flame

### Moments & Encounters

- [ ] *Downtime Session*
- Whatever the party wants to accomplish - lasts about 1 week while they wait for Kazrak to tell the party that they are ready to infiltrate the Boromar HQ.

- [ ] Moment 1: *CotSF*
- **Mother Tulip** from the [[Church of the Silver Flame]] *Order of Ministers* pays the party a visit, stating she has an offer.
	- They know the party plans on infiltrating the HQ, and they want to benefit from that.
	- When the party finds the [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] Baelin ir'Torn had, return it to the CotSF.
	- They are willing to share that they believe the FKD to be *an ancient artifact of great and terrible power*.
	- The CotSF believes it can best protect these shards.
	- **Rewards.** 
		- Money? Magic items? Property? Entry into the church/security clearance?

- [ ] Moment 2: *Bjorn gets a letter from a gargoyle*
- Bjorn is delivered a letter from his mother Traust Ulfr
	- The letter details how [[Plot Web#Hrothgar|Hrothgar]] has grown in power and fallen into darkness, and that more and more of the other clan members have fallen under his power and corruption.
	- It also states that her seer abilities don't work when peering into Hrothgar's future, his future is clouded to her.
	- Somewhere in the letter she also vaguely hints towards seeing into Hrothgar's future when he was a boy.
		- Even since the moment he was born it was more difficult for her to view his future than anyone else.
		- However, when he was a boy, she did foresee him slaying a knight who came to kill him, though she couldn't see any more details.
		- She then briefly explains how a man did come to the camp a year and a half ago and was killed. She says something like, "Though it pains me to write this, I wonder if it should have been Hrothgar thrown off that cliff."
	- It finishes on the note that she is scared of the future, for this is the first time she truly has no idea what is going to happen. 
		- She could even foresee the death of Kvitrafen, Bjorn's father, and though she grieved, it gave her some comfort knowing it was coming.
		- Since Hrothgar's corruption has grown, her ability to peer into his future has diminished until recently, and now she can't see anything involving him.

- [ ] Moment 3: *Trouble with a Spider*
- Kazrak hears posted a guild mission to deal with a spider that has been plaguing an area of Sharn (?). 
	- Can pose an interesting and challenging boss fight with minions, baddies, and a boss. 

- [ ] Moment 4: *Nyx's visions of her daughter*
- Nyx will hallucinate and see her daughter, when she was young, running around somewhere nearby. Only she can see her.
	- This is a hallucination wrought by the power of Kismet, who intents to prepare the party for their terrible battles ahead of them against the agents of Rak Tulkesh.
	- Her hallucination of her daughter will tell her, "*Daddy will have to make a terrible choice, protect him!*"
