**How were the PC's handled for those not in attendance?**
Bjorn faded into the background. Forge went off with Aeren and Baelin to safely escort them to Shavalant.

## To-do for next session
* Need to have an answer ready for if Forge has a crystal in him like the one Geralt has.
* Figure out how to take back the railroading of the party not having enough time to make it to the mountains.
	* Maybe Hank tells them of a path they can take to get there, but will only reach it if the forgo rest for a few nights.
	* Or I could just tell them that as the DM.
	* I feel bad for railroading them into the town quests.
	* How will Varyn cure Geralt?
		* He will show them how to perform the Legacy Stone ritual that will later be used on Vorak. This ritual free's the consciousness from the crystal, giving it ghostly body. It gains power, and becomes aggressive.

## Events of the session summarized:
Interrogated Korvin Thale
* Learned that the FKD fragments contain the consciousness of Rak Tulkesh
* Geralt asked Korvin about Varyn, who didn't know who that is
* Draven had a memory of training with Varyn as a young boy with wooden swords
* Lox has the crazy idea of forcing one of the CotSF higher-ups take over his pact for him\
	* I don't think he will pursue this route
* They let Korven Thale go with the understanding that the church will still pursue the party, and that Korven will continue to follow his orders.
	* The party said they would think about giving the FKD over to the church but made no promises.

Lox had his Kismet reading and had flashbacks to meeting Nyx, having their kid, and his meetings with his patron

Aeren & Baelin told the party that they were going to travel to Shavalant to meet back up with Miri and form a new base of operations there.  They will take Piston with them as well.
* They were concerned for their own safety should they continue to travel with the party.
* The party asked Aeren to create a combat-focused robot similar to piston for them when he arrives at Shavalant.
	* The party wants it named "Delamane"
	* Aeren happily agreed to it, and said he would begin work on it as soon as he arrived.
	* Forge is going to travel with Aeren & Baelin to make sure they arrive safely. He took a horse with them.

They traveled onward to Galethspyre, and met Marta Vex on the way.
* The party gave her some food becasue she seemed haggard and worn.
* She gave all the information she had to the party about the town and the red mists.
* She asked the party to check in on her "friend" (her lover) Bernard McOogle

They entered Galethspyre, witnessed the public trial of Jakob and his lashings.
* Talked to Hank & Chef Nyla after a physical encounter with some goblins of the Red Hands Gang.
* Hank told the party they are welcome to stay in the Broken Mast Tavern tonight and speak to Hank in more detail of the events that transpired in the town.
* After Hank & Chef Nyla left, the party cut down Jakob and asked him some questions. He told them about the gang, how Nyla is a good person whos trying her best, and that they need to be weary of Hank.
* He also mentioned that the gang took Jakob and Nyla to their main camp at the Old Thane's Mine.
	* Chef Nyla returned, but Kynes never did.

The party traveled to the Gilded Grass Apothecary and met Bernard McOogle
* Spoke to Bernard - he was acting crazy, who was definitely kinda high and quite paranoid
* Didn't give them a ton of great info
* The party told him that Marta was OK, and that she is traveling to Shavalant.
* Lox gave him a dreamlily flower for fun and told him to give it to Marta when he sees her.

Geralt asked about how long it would take to get to the peak of the Byeshk Mountains
* I told him he wouldn't have enough time to make it to the peak before his curse takes hold.
* See To-do

They arrived at the Broken Mast Tavern @ approximately 2:30pm
* Saw Gnolls and goblins feasting and the bard playing frantically.
* Hank came and disiplined the feasters, telling them they need to ration more food. They didn't listen.
* Hank invited the party back to his room/office to speak.

Session ended there
