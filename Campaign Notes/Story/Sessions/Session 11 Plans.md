![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

**Blind.** The giant cannot see and is immune to any effect that would require sight. It has blindsight out to 60 feet due to its acute hearing.

**Keen Hearing.** The giant has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

**Plague Carrier.** When a creature starts its turn within 10 feet of the giant, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned this way, the creature takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Water Weakness.** While in direct contact with water, any attacks against the Plague Giant are made with advantage, and the Plague Giant makes all attacks and saving throws with disadvantage.

_**Actions**_  
![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two slam attacks or uses Devastating Charge once.

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12(2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) necrotic damage.

**Devastating Charge.** The giant moves up to its speed in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature or object, treating walls and similar barriers as difficult terrain. Each creature in its path must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. Any walls or barriers in its path take 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage.

_**Bonus Action**_  
![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

**Vomit Plague (Recharge 5–6).** The giant spews diseased bile in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't poisoned.

_**Villain Actions**_ (Once per round, Initiative Count 20)  
![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

**Phase 1: Echo Hunt.** The giant uses echolocation and can pinpoint the location of all creatures within 60 feet. Until the start of its next turn, it has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it detected.

**Phase 2: Rampage.** The giant can use Devastating Charge twice, choosing a different direction for each charge.

**Phase 3: Plague Eruption.** The giant's body violently expels disease in all directions. Each creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and become poisoned until the end of their next turn. Additionally, the area becomes filled with diseased fog until the end of the giant's next turn, heavily obscuring it for all creatures except the giant.

_**Reaction**_  
![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/file-attachments/0/579/stat-block-header-bar.svg)

**Sound Stalker.** When a creature within 60 feet makes a sound (including speaking or casting a spell with verbal components), the giant can immediately move up to half its speed toward that creature without provoking opportunity attacks.
