**Traits**

**Blind but Deadly**: The Plague-Eater is blind and relies on sound to locate its prey. It has **blindsight** out to a range of 60 feet, but is deafened by magical silence. If a creature remains completely still (taking no actions, bonus actions, or reactions), it has advantage on Stealth checks to avoid detection.

**Plague Aura**: Creatures within 10 feet of the Plague-Eater at the start of their turn must make a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. On a failed save, they are also poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on itself on a success.

**Charge of Destruction**: If the Plague-Eater moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 22 (4d10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a **DC 18 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone. If it hits a wall or structure, it instead deals 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage to the barrier.

---

**Actions**

**Multiattack**: The Plague-Eater makes two attacks: one with its Gore and one with its Bite.

**Gore**:  
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
_Hit_: 19 (3d8 + 6) piercing damage.

**Bite**:  
_Melee Weapon Attack_: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
_Hit_: 30 (4d12 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or become infected with a virulent plague. While infected, the creature takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The infection can only be cured by magical healing.

**Deadly Leap (Recharge 5-6)**:  
The Plague-Eater leaps up to 30 feet in a straight line and lands in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each creature in that space must succeed on a **DC 18 Strength or Dexterity saving throw** (targetâ€™s choice) or be knocked prone, take 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage, and be pushed 10 feet away. On a successful save, the creature takes only half damage and isn't knocked prone or pushed.

---

**Reactions**

**Rampage**: When the Plague-Eater reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, it can move up to half its speed and make a Bite attack.

---

**Legendary Actions**

The Plague-Eater can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

- **Move**: The Plague-Eater moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Sonic Pulse (Costs 2 Actions)**: The Plague-Eater emits a pulse of sound to detect hidden enemies. All creatures within 30 feet must make a **DC 16 Dexterity saving throw** or be revealed, losing any benefits of being hidden or invisible.
