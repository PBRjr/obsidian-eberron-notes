Aeren puts together the dots of what the party told him
He learned:
- Modern warforged are the product of the souls of dead soldiers, wiped of their memories and transferred into warforged bodies.
- Geralt's parents created schematics for a strange heart mechanism and wrote it down in an ancient draconic language. The shopping list he found probably has something to do with that
- He concluded that the mechanism has to have something to do with transferring the souls of soldiers into the warforged, especially with them studying a lich phylactery to create it.
- He recognizes the script from an old nursery rhyme his mother used to read to him. He finds the old book, titled "*When the Couatl sing*" and realized it was a draconic script that used to be used by the most devout followers of Siberys, the Dragon Above.
- He went to the library to do research on the language. Unable to find anything on the language, he asked the librarian for their books on religious history. He checked out a book titled "*Godlings, Demigods, and other Mythic Creatures*" and left.
- On his way back, he ran into Boromar Clan thugs, who kidnapped him at the order of Halak Boromar. (He is wanted for his technological ability and knowledge of the arcane. They want to use him to work with the professor and figure out the use/purpose of the FKD fragment they got from the professor.)
- When he is kidnapped, he dropped his book on the ground, which can be found by the party.
- The gang members can also be encountered and looted, and [[Aeren's Notes]] may be looted.
