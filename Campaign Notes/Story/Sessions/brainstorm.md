Aeren puts together the dots of what the party told him
He learned:
- Modern warforged are the product of the souls of dead soldiers, wiped of their memories and transferred into warforged bodies.
- Geralt's parents created schematics for a strange heart mechanism and wrote it down in an ancient draconic language. The shopping list he found probably has something to do with that
- He concluded that the mechanism has to have something to do with transferring the souls of soldiers into the warforged, especially with them studying a lich phylactery to create it.
- He recognizes the script from an old fairytale his mother used to read to him. He finds the old book and realized it was a draconic script that used to be used by the most devout followers of Siberys, the Dragon Above.
