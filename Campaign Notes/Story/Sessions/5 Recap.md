Explored the skirmish sight along the path to The Lighthouse.
- Draven felt a presence watching them during his watch before they packed up camp
- Followed the path down to the creek and dug up the knight's grave, took the pendant and left the sword.
- Continued to the Lighthouse
- Arrived at a clearing in the forest that gave way to the Lighthouse about 200 ft ahead of them
- Saw a warforged sitting by a rock, talked to him, they agreed to investigate the castle together
- the warforged is Forge (new player's character), an artillerist artificer
- They saw no guard
