Explored the skirmish sight along the path to The Lighthouse.
- Draven felt a presence watching them during his watch before they packed up camp
- Followed the path down to the creek and dug up the knight's grave, took the pendant and left the sword.

Continued down the path to the Lighthouse a few hours away.
- Arrived at a clearing in the forest that gave way to the Lighthouse about 200 ft ahead of them
- Saw a warforged sitting by a rock, talked to him, they agreed to investigate the castle together
- the warforged is Forge (new player's character), an artillerist artificer
- They saw no guard presence or anyone else
- Noticed an old man peeking into the building through windows around the back
	- Confronted him, said his name is Rob and he is a traveller that has been staying in the area for a while
	- Said he and his daughter went on a hike and both got lost, and he returned to see if she made it back to the castle
	- Said he went to the front but saw them kicked down and decided to not go in yet.
	- Asked the party to help him find his daughter.

The party & Rob enter the castle through the front doors.
- They investigate the aftermath of a chaotic siege by unknown demonic forces.
- Seems similar to the battle that   occurred on the path that they noticed earlier.
- Rob says his daughter is probably downstairs in the "safe room"
- The party makes their way downstairs and finds their way down a hidden trapdoor within the storage area.

They enter a secret basement area that contains a sealed large metal door.
- They are forced to answer a question about the CotSF, and after searching for the answers in the library, they are granted passage.
- They find the teleportation circle, and Geralt steps on it, arriving
