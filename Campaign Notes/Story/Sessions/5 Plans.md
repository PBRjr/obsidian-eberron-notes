- **Signs pointing to agents:** scorched paw prints, tufts of burnt black fur (*hellhounds*) | claw markings in rock, small black barbs embedded in trees (*imps*) | cooled, hardened lava splatters (*magma memphites*). Small piles of ash scatter the area.
- A perception check reveals flattened grass from a recently walked bath down to a small rocky creek bed that has dried up. A recent grave covered in smooth stones can be easily spotted.

	- He is buried along with a pendant of the Silver Flame and his issued sword, "Holy Silver".
	- ***Holy Silver.*** + 1 silvered longsword. Attacks count as magical. Looks like it was build for function. Blade and handle are impeccably polished, the handle made of a white marble and sanded smooth.*
