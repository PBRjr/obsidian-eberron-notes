- DOES NOT KNOW: Castar's motives, deeper questions about the workings of the clan.

_Plot Information_
- Seeks to bring the town under Boromar control through protection racket and intimidation. Reason clan wants to control Shavalant:
	- Water tower is a unique piece of magitech - knowledge of workings could be worth good money
	- Shavalant is along a commonly traveled road - traveling merchants can be easily extorted.


Person 2: Orc 1 & 3

- Dumb and strong. Will not succumb to physical torture, can be easily tricked into giving up information.
- DO KNOW: they were told to 'keep an eye' on Garhorn.
- DO NOT KNOW: Much else. Basic info about the clan.

_Plot Information_

- Typical brutes, low knowledge of clan workings, low knowledge of current job. Loyal to Halak Boromar, were sent along with Garhorn as Halak's way of keeping an eye on things.
- Many such 'guards' were sent along with Castar's men as a result of the inner conflict of the Clan

Person 3: [[Its Kismet|Kismet]]

- Will find a way to convince the PCs to have their fates read.
- Appears as small graying half-elf woman, acts a bit crazy.

- A young orc boy that provides light hearted roleplay opportunity and reveals Draven's status as a known hero.

Person 5: Chewy

- The Kobold that was covered in oil in session 2 that escaped and was captured by the gang members. Will be very scared.
- DOES KNOW: SotDoK is a fairly new group put together by Brains in an effort to create his own clan, he was always vague about their rituals, kept information to himself. Demanded a lot from the members.
- DOES NOT KNOW: Who Woe is, why they attacked the airship, why they took Marsh.

- Castar's men are trying to establish control in smaller strategic locations across the continent

Action 2: Lords of Dust

- Goal: Retrieve the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard Fragments

### Additional Notes

- Remember the Ankheg head in the field and decide how it has affected the local area.
