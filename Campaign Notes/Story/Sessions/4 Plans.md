**Moment 3**

#### Locations

- **Boromar Gang Campsite.** Finalize the campsite encounter with detailed maps and NPC strategies.
- **Site of skirmish between CotSF knights and LoD agents.** Found on any road or path traveling to Sharn.

#### People

- **Garhorn.** Sounds like Billy Butcher. Mid 30's halfling, black hair, polite and manipulative, fiercly loyal to the clan.
	- DOES KNOW & WILL GIVE UP: Part of the Boromar clan, sent to create a protection racket, location of valuables.
	- DOES KNOW & WON'T GIVE UP: Bosses name, anything that humiliates him, anything that can be directly used against the clan.
	- DOES NOT KNOW: Castar's motives, deeper questions about the workings of the clan.
- **Orc 1 & 3.**  Dumb and strong. Typical brutes, low knowledge of clan workings, low knowledge of current job. Loyal to Halak Boromar, were sent along with Garhorn as Halak's way of keeping an eye on things.
	- Will not succumb to physical torture, can be easily tricked into giving up information.
	- DO KNOW: they were told to 'keep an eye' on Garhorn.
	- DO NOT KNOW: Much else. Basic info about the clan.
- **Oak Dryfire.** A young orc boy that provides light hearted roleplay opportunity and reveals Draven's status as a known hero.
- **Chewy.** The Kobold that was covered in oil in [[2 Recap|session 2]] that escaped and was captured by the gang members. Will be very scared. 
	- DOES KNOW: SotDoK is a fairly new group put together by Brains in an effort to create his own clan, he was always vague about their rituals, kept information to himself. Demanded a lot from the members.
	- DOES NOT KNOW: Who Woe is, why they attacked the airship, why they took Marsh.

#### Encounters

- **Boromar Gang Campsite Encounter.** The outcome of this encounter could shape the party's reputation in Sharn and their status with the Boromar Clan
- **Random Encounters.** If the party aquires horses and begins their journey, they may have a random encounter
- **Desolated Village.** During their journey, the party will come across a town that was devastated by Vorak, leaving only a few angry survivors, providing opportunity for more random encounters with various creatures.
- **Remains of LoD & CotSF Battle.** Party may come upon the reminants of a fight between evil creatures and the security detail for Baelin. The CotSF won, but lost a member.
	- Scorch marks, broken arrows, and dried blood tells the story of a short skirmish, the result of an ambush that originated from a tree line along the road.
	- A small rock burial can be found a small walk away. Inside is the corpse of a strong-jawed human draped with a white canvas cloth. He holds a Silver Flame pendant, a metal arrowhead with a silver flame running along it, in addition to his Holy Sword set next to him.
		- ***Holy Sword.*** +1 Great sword. Utilitarian in its design, the shining silvery metal of this weapon stays clean and gleaming despite constant use-and-abuse. A subtle off-white flame decorates the thick metal handle, its harsh angles making the thing uncomfortable to wield.
	- An ash-covered burn pile can be found just off the road, various blood trails telling a story.
#### Additional Notes

- Remember the Ankheg head in the field and decide how it has affected the local area.
- Be prepared for the party's actions to have long-term effects on their relationship with the Boromar Clan.
- Keep track of unresolved threads from session 3 that could resurface in Sharn.
