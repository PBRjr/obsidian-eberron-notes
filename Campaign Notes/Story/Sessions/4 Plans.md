#### Locations

- **Boromar Gang Campsite.** Finalize the campsite encounter with detailed maps and NPC strategies.
- **Shavalant.** 

#### People

- **Garhorn.** Sounds like Billy Butcher. Mid 30's halfling, black hair, polite and manipulative.
	- DOES KNOW: 
- **Oak Dryfire.** A young orc boy that provides light hearted roleplay opportunity and reveals Draven's status as a known hero.
- **Chewy.** The Kobold that was covered in oil in [[2 Recap|session 2]] that escaped and was captured by the gang members. Will be very scared. 
	- DOES KNOW: SotDoK is a fairly new group put together by Brains in an effort to create his own clan, he was always vague about their rituals, kept information to himself. Demanded a lot from the members.
	- DOES NOT KNOW: Who Woe is, why they attacked the airship, why they took Marsh.

#### Encounters

- **Boromar Gang Campsite Encounter.** The outcome of this encounter could shape the party's reputation in Sharn and their status with the Boromar Clan
- **Random Encounters.** If the party aquires horses and begins their journey, they may have a random encounter
- **Desolated Village.** During their journey, the party will come across a town that was devastated by Vorak, leaving only a few angry survivors, providing opportunity for more random encounters with various creatures.
#### Additional Notes

- Remember the Ankheg head in the field and decide how it has affected the local area.
- Be prepared for the party's actions to have long-term effects on their relationship with the Boromar Clan.
- Keep track of unresolved threads from session 3 that could resurface in Sharn.
