5. The party encounters the Plague Giant, who kills the guard helping Kazrak.

7. Draven uses a summoned mastiff to distract the giant, who creates a hole in the wall to the mechanical room that controls the leyline power for the doors out.
8. The party defeats the giant, then turns on the leyline converters, opening a portcullis.
