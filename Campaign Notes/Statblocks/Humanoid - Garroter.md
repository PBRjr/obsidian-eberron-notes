**Strangle.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until the grapple ends, the target can’t speak intelligibly or cast spells with verbal components. If the attack was made with advantage, the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target falls unconscious for 1 minute (save ends at the start of its turn) or until they take damage. A creature can use an action to shake another creature awake who has fallen unconscious this way.  

**Dagger.** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the attack was made with advantage, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) piercing damage.

**Cloak (1/Day).** The garroter magically turns invisible for 1 minute. Any equipment the garroter wears or carries is invisible with them. While invisible, the garroter’s movements make no sound. If the garroter hits a creature with an attack, casts a spell, or takes damage, the effect ends.
