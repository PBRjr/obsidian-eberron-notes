**Arcane Staff.** _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 21 (6d6) cold damage.  

**Gust of Wind (1/Day).** A 10-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line of strong wind gusts from the cryomancer for 1 minute. Each creature who starts their turn in the area must succeed on a *DC 15 Strength saving throw* or be pushed 15 feet away. Creatures moving toward the cryomancer must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved.  

**Ice Storm (3/Day).** The cryomancer calls down a hail of ice in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder within 300 feet. Each creature in the area must make a *DC 15 Dexterity saving throw,* taking 20 (4d8) cold damage and 10 (2d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half on a success.
