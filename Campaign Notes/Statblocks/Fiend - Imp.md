**Shapechanger.** The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a rat, raven, or spider, or back to its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for changes noted for speed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the imp's darkvision.
