**Surprise Attack.** If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it during the first round, the attack deals an extra 10 (3d6) damage.

**Read Thoughts.** The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet. Barriers such as 3 feet of wood or dirt, or a thin sheet of lead, block this effect. While reading thoughts, the doppelganger has advantage on Insight and Charisma checks against the creature.
