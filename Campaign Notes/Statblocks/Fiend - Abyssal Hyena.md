**Death Snap.** When the hyena is reduced to 0 hit points, they can deal 1 piercing damage to a creature within 5 feet of them (no action required), provided they werenâ€™t incapacitated before dropping to 0 hit points.

**Minion.** If the hyena takes damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, their hit points are reduced to 0. If the hyena takes damage from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum; otherwise, they take no damage.

**Bite (Group Attack).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 1 piercing damage. If the target is a creature and two or more hyenas joined the attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The DC for this saving throw equals 10 plus the number of hyenas who joined the attack.
