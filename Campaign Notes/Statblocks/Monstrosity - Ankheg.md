**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until the grapple ends, the Ankheg can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.  

**Acid Spray (Recharge 6).** The Ankheg spits acid in a 10-foot square within 30 feet. Creatures in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  

_**Villain Actions**_

- **Bloody Rage.** When reduced to half its health or less, the Ankheg secretes acid, covering the ground around it in difficult terrain, then burrows up to 10 feet underground, avoiding opportunity attacks.  
- **Acid Pores.** When hit by a melee attack during its Bloody Rage, the attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Strength check or have their weapon lodged in the Ankheg's body, where acid corrodes it into an improvised weapon.
