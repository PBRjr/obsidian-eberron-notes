**Multiattack.** The giant makes two slam attacks or uses Devastating Charge once.  

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) necrotic damage.  

**Devastating Charge.** The giant moves up to its speed in a straight line, moving through creatures or objects as difficult terrain. Creatures in its path must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage on a failed save and falling prone. On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked prone. Barriers take 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage.

**Vomit Plague (Recharge 5–6).** The giant spews diseased bile in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage and being poisoned until the end of their next turn on a failed save. On a success, they take half damage and are not poisoned.

- **Phase 1: Echo Hunt.** The giant uses echolocation to pinpoint all creatures within 60 feet. Until the start of its next turn, it has advantage on attack rolls against detected creatures.  
- **Phase 2: Rampage.** The giant uses Devastating Charge twice in different directions.  
- **Phase 3: Plague Eruption.** Creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and become poisoned until their next turn. The area fills with diseased fog, heavily obscuring it until the end of the giant's next turn.
