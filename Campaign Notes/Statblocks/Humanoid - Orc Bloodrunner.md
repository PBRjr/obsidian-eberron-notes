**Relentless (1/Turn).** When the bloodrunner isn’t incapacitated and they are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, they can make an attack against an enemy (no action required) before the hit point reduction is resolved.

**Unimpeded.** The bloodrunner can occupy a prone creature’s space. The first time the bloodrunner enters a prone creature’s space on their turn, the prone creature takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage. When a prone creature in the bloodrunner’s space stands up, they must enter the nearest unoccupied space of their choice.
