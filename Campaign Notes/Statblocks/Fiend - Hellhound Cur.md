_Crossfire._ If a creature starts its turn within 10 feet of two or more curs, that creature takes 4 fire damage.

_Minion._ If the cur takes damage from an attack or a failed saving throw, its hit points are reduced to 0. It dies outright if it takes damage from another effect that equals or exceeds its hit point maximum; otherwise, it takes no damage.

**Hellish Bite (Group Attack).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 3 fire damage. If the target isnâ€™t a hellhound and the attack was made by more than one cur, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 10 plus the number of curs who joined the attack. On a failed save, the target is set on fire (save ends at the end of turn). A creature on fire takes fire damage equal to the number of curs that joined the attack at the start of its turn.
