**Exploit Weakness.** When the guard makes or joins an attack that's made with advantage, the attack deals an extra 1 damage per guard who made or joined the attack.  
**Minion.** If the guard takes damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, their hit points are reduced to 0. If the guard takes damage from another effect, they die if the damage equals or exceeds their hit point maximum; otherwise, they take no damage.  
**Overwhelm.** If a Medium or smaller enemy starts their turn within 5 feet of three or more guards who can see them, the enemy's speed is reduced by 5 feet for each guard within 5 feet. If this reduces the enemy's walking speed to 0, they are restrained until the start of their next turn.
