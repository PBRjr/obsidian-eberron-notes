**Fire Bomb.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6 + 3) fire damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take an additional 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of its next turn.  

**Flashbang.** The alchemist throws a flashbang potion at a point within range. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded and deafened until the end of their next turn.  

**Sticky Goo Bomb.** The alchemist throws a sticky goo bomb at a point within range. The bomb explodes in a 10-foot-radius, coating the area in sticky goo. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of their next turn. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within reach on a success.  

**Smoke Bomb.** The alchemist throws a smoke bomb at a point within range. The bomb releases a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area in a 10-foot radius. The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed disperses it.

**Vanish.** When the alchemist is the target of an attack, they can drop a Smoke Bomb at their feet, giving their attacker disadvantage on the attack and allowing the alchemist to move on their next turn as though they took the Disengage action.
