**Multiattack.** The summoner makes two attacks using Bite, Three-Tail Flail, Fire Blast, or a combination of them. They can replace one attack with a use of Demonic Howl, if available.

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, another creature the summoner can see within 30 feet of them magically regains 7 (2d6) hit points. If this attack is made against a willing ally, it automatically hits.

**Three-Tail Flail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (3d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is pushed 5 feet away from the summoner.

**Fire Blast (Cantrip).** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (3d6) fire damage.

**Demonic Howl (Recharge 5–6).** Until the beginning of the summoner’s next turn, each ally within 30 feet of the summoner who can hear them has advantage on attack rolls.

**Uplift (3/Day).** The gnoll magically turns an allied abyssal hyena into a **gnoll marauder** for 1 hour.

**Summon Abyssal Hyenas (3/Day).** The summoner summons 1d4 + 1 **abyssal hyenas**, which appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of the summoner. The hyenas act immediately after the summoner’s turn and follow the summoner’s commands.

**Death Frenzy.** When an ally the summoner can see within 30 feet of them is reduced to 0 hit points, the summoner moves up to half their speed and makes a Bite attack.
