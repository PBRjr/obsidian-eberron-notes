**Multiattack.** The bonesplitter makes two attacks using Bite, Spiked Flail, or both. They can replace one attack with a use of Bloody Roar, if available.

**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage if the target is restrained.

**Spiked Flail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, they are grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the bonesplitter can’t make Spiked Flail attacks.

**Bloody Roar (Recharge 6).** The bonesplitter roars, spitting a spray of blood. Each ally within 10 feet of them who can see them can make a weapon attack (no action required), provided that ally isn’t incapacitated.

**Over Here!** The bonesplitter yanks a creature they are grappling. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or swap spaces with the bonesplitter.

**Death Frenzy.** When an ally the bonesplitter can see within 30 feet of them is reduced to 0 hit points, the bonesplitter moves up to half their speed and makes a Bite attack.
