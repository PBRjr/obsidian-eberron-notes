**Charge.** If the raider moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and hits with a melee attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 3 (1d6) damage.  
**Exploit Opening (3/Day).** When the raider makes an attack, they have advantage on the attack roll.

**Splinter Shield.** When wielding a shield and hit by an attack, the raider gains a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If this causes the attack to miss, the shield breaks, and until replaced, the raider's AC is reduced by 2, and they can't use this reaction or make a Shield Shove attack.
