**Electric Gauntlets.** The Brawler's fists are outfitted with electric gauntlets that deal an additional 2d6 lightning damage on a hit and allow them to make ranged attacks.  
**Heavy Armor Master.** The Brawler reduces any non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage they take by 3 due to heavy armor plating.  
**Boosters.** The Brawler can fly and hover thanks to boosters installed in its legs.

**Multiattack.** The Brawler makes two attacks using Grab, Haymaker, or Electric Arc.  

**Grab.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. _Hit:_ 6 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the Brawler can't grab another creature.  

**Haymaker.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, or 10 (3d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage against a grappled target plus 3 (1d6) lightning damage.  

**Throw.** The Brawler throws one Medium or smaller creature they are grappling or object they are holding up to 30 feet horizontally. If the thrown target is a creature, they fall prone after the throw. If the thrown target would enter the space of a creature or solid object no more than one size smaller than it, the thrown target collides with it and stops in the nearest unoccupied space, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. A Large or smaller creature hit by the thrown target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same amount of damage and fall prone.  

**Electric Arc.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (2d8 + 3) lightning damage.

**Meat Shield.** When the Brawler is grappling a target and is hit by a ranged attack made by another creature the Brawler can see, the Brawler gains a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If this bonus causes the attack to miss, the attack hits the grappled target instead.
