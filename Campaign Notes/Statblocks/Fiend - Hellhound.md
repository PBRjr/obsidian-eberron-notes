_Hardened by Flame._ When the hellhound is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage. Instead, its skin darkens and hardens, and its AC increases to 18 until the end of its next turn.

_Keen Smell._ The hellhound has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track other creatures and on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide from creatures who are unaware of its presence.

_**Actions**_

**Hellish Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) fire damage.

**Hellfire Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).** The hellhound exhales flame in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (3d6 + 4) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw is also on fire for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn) unless it or another creature within reach uses an action to extinguish the flames. A creature on fire takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of its turn.

**Pack Tactics.** When an enemy within 5 feet of the hellhound hits it with a melee attack, the hound can make a Hellish Bite attack against that enemy. If the attack hits, the enemy is grappled (escape DC 12), and a weapon used in the triggering attack cannot be used to make further attacks while the enemy is grappled.
