**Take This!** If the Dragonshield is about to be struck by a projectile, it may use its reaction to bring up its shield. If it does, a kobold ally within 5 feet takes the effect of the projectile instead.

**Hidden Net.** The Dragonshield directs another kobold to throw a net on a nearby enemy, reducing their movement to 0 and giving them disadvantage on attacks unless they succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.  
**Oil Slick.** The Dragonshield directs another kobold to dump 2 buckets of oil on or near the closest enemies in a 10x10 ft. area. Any creature in the area must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. If the oil is lit on fire, affected creatures take 2d4 fire damage at the start of their turn.
