**Relentless (1/Turn).** When reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, the godcaller can make an attack against an enemy before the hit point reduction is resolved. If this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the godcaller drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Power Chord (1st-Level Spell).** _Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one creature who can hear the godcaller. _Hit:_ 18 (4d6 + 4) thunder damage.  

**Cadenza.** The godcaller chooses a creature within 30 feet who can hear them. The target can use their reaction to move up to their speed and make an attack.  

**Song of the Gods (2nd-Level Spell).** The godcaller and allies within 30 feet who can hear them have advantage on attack rolls until the start of the godcallerâ€™s next turn. This ends early if the godcaller takes damage.
