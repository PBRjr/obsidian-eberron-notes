_Bone Weapons._ The skeleton's weapon attacks are magical. It uses its bones as ammunition for its bone bow, regrowing used bones every dusk.  
_Minion._ If the skeleton takes damage from an attack or as the result of a failed saving throw, its hit points are reduced to 0. If it takes damage from another effect, it dies if the damage equals or exceeds its hit point maximum; otherwise it takes no damage.
