**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 14). The zombie has two fists, each of which can grapple one target.

**Toxic Exhalation (Recharge 5â€“6).** The zombie spews toxic vomit in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
