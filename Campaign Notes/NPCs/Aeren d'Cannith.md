### Workshop
Aeren's workshop is located in *Everbright, Middle Menthis* and is rather unassuming on the outside.

The interior is filled with small contraptions, decorations, and bland but functional furniture. Lit by Everbright lanterns, it has a cozy feel. It has 3 stories, the uppers mostly serving as guest rooms.

The only other resident is *Piston*, a short machination who is Aeren's clockwork assistant. He is able to take simple commands, however he is not sentient.

### Backstory

A proficient and acclaimed artificer of House Cannith (invented the Everbright lantern), Aeren holds the title of the youngest Master Artificer [[House Cannith]] has ever known. Having been born outside of the Dragonmarked house to an Elven mother and human father, Aeren is also the only Master Artificer that does not bare a *Mark of Making.

After becoming a Master Artificer, he was gifted an old and almost forgotten workshop to use as his own. He was always obsessed with the great warforged creations, though his probing questions were always met with standard answers. The mystery only served to intrigue Aeren more.

After some investigation, Aeren dug up old documents that listed required strange components for a new theoretical creation. The document was signed by Yelena and Norbit Wolfsbane.
