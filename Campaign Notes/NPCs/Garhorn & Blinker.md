### Concept 

Once a proud member of the Boromar Clan, loyal to Castar, Garhorn now drinks his day away in the streets of Sharn. After his encounter with the party, he spends his days picking up odd jobs to support his drinking. His blink dog Blinker remains fiercly loyal, always by his side, watching his back while he sleeps away his intoxication.

### Description

- A short gnome [[Statblocks#Enchanter|enchanter]] that smells of bourbon and bad decisions.
- Wears rugged clothing too warm for the heat and with too many holes for the cold.
- Unclean, unshaven,  uncaring.

### Roleplaying Tips

- Sounds like Billy Butcher from the show "The Boys"
- He holds no ill-will against the party, and is even willing to help them with the odd job.
- The one thing he loves more than drinking is Blinker. I will give his life without hesitation to protect his cainine friend.
