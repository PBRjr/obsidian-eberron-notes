*Nadim al-Nur -- The Regretful Survivor*

---

Varyn was never the best at anything among his people. He was never a fighter, nor a great user of the arcane or the divine. While still a powerful [[Couatl]], amongst his kind he was simply average.

He supported his people during the [[Age of Demons]] however he could. When the time came to make [[The Great Sacrifice]], he found that he didn't have the courage to go through with it. He abandoned his people, choosing instead to form [[Clan Flameforge]], and training those within to fight against the forces of Khyber.

Through Clan Flameforge he trained Draven as a paladin of [[Progenitor Dragons|Siberys, the Dragon Above]]. Seeing Draven defeated was yet another event that Varyn perceived as his own failure.

How could Varyn continue to lead Clan Flameforge when his greatest soldier wasn't even enough? He walked away from the clan, and now lives isolated somewhere in the mountains.
