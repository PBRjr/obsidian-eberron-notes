*Basirah -- The Wandering Seer*

---

**Kismet** is one of the two Coautl that still remain on Eberron after [[The Great Sacrifice]], the other being [[Varyn]].

Kismet presents herself as a frazzled old half-elf woman, with a weak frame and loose skin. She roams Eberron, always appearing where she feels she is most needed. Sometimes she presents herself as a seer needing help with a broken wagon. Other times she's simply an old lady sitting by herself at a campfire. Either way, she always finds her way to those who need her.

Being a Coautl, Kismet possesses the ability to read the signs of the [[Draconic Prophecy]]. She uses these signs to ensure the right events happen at the right time to prevent the reemergence of the Overlords and to fight the [[Lords of Dust]].

Kismet and [[Varyn]] are aware of eachother's existance, though they do not work together. Kismet keeps herself hidden from Varyn. She is disappointed in his cowardice during [[The Great Sacrifice]].
