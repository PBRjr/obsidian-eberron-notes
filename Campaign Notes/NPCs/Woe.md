Woe is a decommissioned warforged soldier who served with distinction in the Last War. After the Treaty of Thronehold left him without purpose, he willingly underwent a profane ritual by [[Mordakesh]] to replace his heart with a [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard|Khyber dragonshard fragment]], granting him sinister powers as a [[Woe#Abilities & Powers|Warlock Lich]].

Woe was an elite warforged soldier constructed centuries ago by[[ House Cannith]]. He was unwaveringly loyal and skilled in warfare. One day in the midst of battle, Woe was struck down and killed by a halfling known as *Dandal*.

Dandal had been carrying a "lucky" family heirloom - a small fragment of a larger [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] - which attached a dark cancer upon Woe's soul as he died. 

Woe awoke, months later, in the laboratories of [[Mordakhesh]], having been revived and put back together, piece-by-piece.

Mordakesh promised him a new reason for being - serving the overlord [[Rak Tulkesh]]. Woe agreed to undergo a profane ritual that fused a Khyber dragonshard fragment containing a sliver of the overlord's essence into his metallic body, awakening sinister powers.

### Abilities & Powers
- Granted Warlock-like abilities from his patron [[Rak Tulkesh]].
- His phylactery is the [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber shard]] resting in the center of his chest.
- The shard contains both a small sliver of Rak Tulkesh's power and part of Woe's soul.
- The dragonshard is indestructible, due to the power contained within.
	- If Woe is killed, his soul will remain in the shard until it can take over the body of another creature
	- As Woe gathers more [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] fragments, Rak Tulkesh's influence over Woe will grow until he is completely under the Overlord's control.
