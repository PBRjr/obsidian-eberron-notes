Varyn was never the best at anything among his people. He was never a fighter, nor a great user of the arcane or the divine. While still a powerful [[Coautl]], amongst his kind he was simply average.

He supported his people during the [[Age of Demons]] however he could. When the time came to make [[The Great Sacrifice]], he found that he didn't have the courage to go through with it. He abdonded his people, choosing instead to form [[Clan Flameforge]], and training those within to fight against the forces of Khyber.

Through Clan Flameforge he trained Draven Flameforge as a paladin of [[Progenitor Dragons|Siberys, the Dragon Above]].
