### Concept

Halas Tarkanan was a skilled military commander and powerful aberrant dragonmark bearer who led the resistance against the dragonmarked houses during the War of the Mark. He was a tragic figure, driven by a desire for justice and vengeance, ultimately sacrificing himself to protect his people.

### Description

- Appearance: A battle-hardened human man with a stern expression. His aberrant dragonmark, likely visible on his skin, pulses with barely contained power.
- Personality: Calm and controlled on the surface, masking inner turmoil and rage. Strategic, ruthless when necessary, but deeply committed to protecting other aberrants.
- Mannerisms: Speaks with measured words, rarely raising his voice. Often seen in deep thought, planning the next move.

### Roleplaying Tips

Portray Halas as a man carrying a great burden. Speak with authority and conviction, but hint at the emotional toll of leadership. In combat situations, describe his actions as precise and calculated.
