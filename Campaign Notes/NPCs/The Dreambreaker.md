### Concept

The Dreambreaker was a gnome with immense psionic power granted by his aberrant mark, capable of shattering minds and possibly manipulating time and space. His unstable perception of reality made him both a powerful ally and a dangerous wildcard in the War of the Mark.

### Description

- Appearance: A gnome with unfocused, constantly shifting eyes. His aberrant mark might appear to move or change when looked at directly.
- Personality: Erratic and unpredictable, with moments of startling lucidity. Deeply committed to the aberrant cause, but often misunderstands the nature of their struggle.
- Mannerisms: Speaks in riddles or non-sequiturs. Sometimes pauses mid-sentence as if listening to unheard voices.

### Roleplaying Tips

Portray the Dreambreaker as someone constantly shifting between different perceptions of reality. His speech should be disjointed and cryptic, with occasional moments of stark clarity. Emphasize the unnerving effect he has on those around him.

### Backstory

### Motivations

- Alignment: Chaotic Neutral

### Allies & Enemies
