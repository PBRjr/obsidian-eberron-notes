Race: Halfling

---

Thought House Jorasco will provide healing services to all who need it (and all who can afford it), there are rumors that House Jorasco worked with [[House Vadalis]] during the [[Last War]], potentially developing biological weapons.

While the exact prices for specific treatments may vary, House Jorasco always strives to find a balance between sustaining their operations and fulfilling their mission of providing healing and restoration to all who seek it.

---

### Diamond Conspiracy
Immortality is bad for business. House Jorasco thrives on being the premier source of healing and ressurection, the latter part of which generates them a significant amount of money. Cheap ressurection isn't easy to come by - and House Jorasco leaders make sure it stays that way.

The lowest and most available form of true ressurection is _Revivify_. With access to a large diamond, any common cleric could perform ressurection services, potentially sucking away profits and renown from Jorasco clerics.

Did you know diamonds really aren't that hard to find? In fact, Eberron has a wealth of diamonds in it's cave systems. However, shady contracts, lobbying, and intimidation with governments and land owners has allowed House Jorasco to establish a near monopoly on diamond mining, allowing them to exponentially inflate their price.

This is a secret kept close to the House's chest, and they don't take kindly to purchased from unsanctioned dealers, nor do they enjoy lowly adventurers asking questions.
