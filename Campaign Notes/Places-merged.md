## Description
>  Surrounded by vast oceans and filled with badlands, Argonnessen is more a legend than a place.

## Travel
### Travel Time
Travel in Sharn can be unpredictable. Residents joke that it takes about an hour to get anywhere, whether it’s just down three levels in the same tower or all the way across town. Of course, skycoaches reduce the time dramatically compared to walking from place to place, and characters who really know their way around (as well as characters who are willing to ask for directions frequently along the way) can get to their destinations more quickly than newcomers who refuse to display their ignorance. 

If it becomes important to know how long it takes to get from one place to another, use the following rules of thumb:

| Mode of Travel and Destination         | Travel Time*    |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Foot Travel                            |                 |
| Destination in same district           | 3d6 minutes     |
| Destination in same ward               | 6d6 minutes     |
| Destination in adjacent ward           | 3d6 × 5 minutes |
| Destination farther than adjacent ward | 6d6 × 5 minutes |
| Flying Travel                          |                 |
| Destination in same district           | 1d6 minutes     |
| Destination in same ward               | 2d6 minutes     |
| Destination in adjacent ward           | 1d6 × 5 minutes |
| Destination farther than adjacent ward | 2d6 × 5 minutes |

- A party can reduce this time by one-half if one character makes a successful DC 15 investigation 

- Numbers in parentheses are for magebred horses with the swift breed special quality

### Shavalant



## Description
> Nestled along a winding dirt road, just south of Lake Galifar, lies a quaint village. As you approach, you notice the rhythmic clinking of tools and the soft murmur of voices emanating from small shops and houses clustered together. A few houses are blackened and charred, and seemed to have partially collapsed. The buildings themselves are worn but well-kept, surrounded by fields of crops, some of which are parsley scattered with workers. The air carries the earthy scent of tilled soil and fresh produce. A large metal water tower stands out like a soar thumb, its network of magical pipes extending from the tower into the ground. If you hold your breath, you can almost hear a low-pitched hum emanating from the thing.

###### Texts.
*"Ancient Clay Tablets"*
	...and so it came to pass that the Couatl, in their ultimate act of selflessness, bound the Overlord Rak Tulkhesh within the depths of Khyber. His rage, once a tempest that threatened to consume the world, was contained within a prison of their own making. The land trembled as his prison was forged, and the echoes of his fury were silenced for an age.

*Artifacts of the First Age"*
	"...Among the relics of the bygone era, few hold the mystique and power of Etherseraph, the White Flame Blade. Its origins shrouded in myth and legend, this ethereal weapon is said to have been wielded by champions of light in the age before the Church of the Silver Flame. Forged from the very essence of celestial fire, Etherseraph is more than just a blade; it is a conduit of divine energy, capable of banishing darkness and vanquishing evil. Legends speak of its ability to cleave through the fabric of reality, opening pathways to other realms and dimensions. Though its whereabouts remain unknown, the tales of Etherseraph continue to inspire awe and wonder, a testament to the enduring power of light in the face of darkness..."

*"The Chronicles of the Silver Flame"*
    "In the darkest hour, when all hope seemed lost, the couatls made the ultimate sacrifice. Their essence merged, forming a beacon of pure light - the Silver Flame. Its radiance pierced the darkness, driving back the forces of evil and offering solace to the righteous."

*"On the Ethereal Chains: The Pursuit of Life Beyond Death"*
	"The quest for immortality often leads down a path shadowed by ethereal chains. Ancient scholars posited the existence of a soul's anchor—a phylactery—yet, warned of its tether to undeath. A new school of thought, however, seeks the dawn beyond this twilight. Imagine an ethereal crucible, not for ensnaring the soul in a cycle of undeath, but as a bastion for the living essence. A vessel, perhaps, that might harbor the spark of life eternal, untainted by necrosis. Such are the whispers of alchemists and arcanists alike, dreaming of a future where life knows no end."

*"~~Khyber's Darkness: A Study of the Draconic Prophecy~~"*
    "The fragments of ~~Khyber~~, born ~~from the Dragon Below~~, hold untold power. When ~~united~~ they have the potential to unleash great ~~darkness~~ upon the world. The Draconic ~~Prophecy speaks~~ of a time when the fragments shall align, and the forces of ~~shadow~~ will rise once more."

*"The Argent Grimoire: Teachings of the Silver Flame"*
    "Those who follow the path of the Silver Flame must embody its virtues: courage, sacrifice, and unwavering devotion. Through faith and righteous action, the followers of the Flame become beacons of hope in a world beset by darkness. Their magic, fueled by the Flame's radiance, is a potent weapon against the forces of evil."

*"The Shattered Shard: An Account of the Last War"*
     "During the Last War, the nations of Khorvaire clashed in a brutal conflict that reshaped the face of the continent. Amidst the chaos, a great cataclysm struck: the Mourning. The once-mighty nation of Cyre was consumed by a mysterious mist, leaving only the blasted wasteland now known as the Mournland. The cause of this tragedy remains unknown, but rumors persist of dark magic and forbidden experiments gone awry."

*"The Annals of House Cannith"*
    "House Cannith, bearer of the Mark of Making, has long been at the forefront of arcane innovation. Their creations, from the majestic warforged to the convenience of the Everbright lantern, have shaped the course of history.

*"The Flame's Sacrifice: A Martyr's Tale"*
    "Tira Miron, a paladin of the Silver Flame, faced a terrible choice. To save the world from a great evil, she willingly offered herself as a vessel for the Flame's power. In a blinding flash of radiance, Tira ascended, becoming one with the Silver Flame. Her sacrifice stands as a testament to the depths of devotion and the unyielding spirit of those who serve the Flame."

*"The Mimic: How to Identify a Lurking Threat"*
	Its a mimic.

Query 1
> Name the martyr who gave themselves to kindle the Silver Flame.

###### Teleportation Circle
- Faded circle carved into the stone ground > draconic runes > destination of the Kogs in Sharn

### The Shadow's Cradle


AKA ***The Tower of Old***

**Backstory:** This dilapidated, hidden underground tower is surrounded by boiling pools of lava deep below Sharn. Difficult to find, the Shadow's Cradle is far from comforting. Its origin unknown, it was gifted to Woe by his master Mordakhesh as a place to recover and develop his newfound abilities.

### Woe's Journal Entries:

*Moral Questions*
> Mordakhesh speaks of liberation, of breaking the chains that bind us. But what if these new chains are just as strong, just as suffocating? What if this power consumes me, turns me into the very weapon I was built to be?

*Determination*
> I must understand this gift, this curse. I must find my own path, forge my own destiny. For I am no longer just a soldier, no longer just a tool. He shed from me my prison of blood and flesh and made me anew. I am Woe, and I will not be controlled.

*Purpose*
> The orders barked, the battles fought, the endless cycle of war. Was that truly purpose? Or just another form of slavery?

*Greater Good*
> Was it truly for the greater good, or was it just blind obedience to a flawed system?

*You killed them*
> Choosing to sacrifice another man isn't an act of valor or righteousness. It is a shadowed deed, veiled in the guise of necessity, yet it remains nothing less than murder. You killed them. You killed me. You killed us all.

### The Temple of the Endless Rage


# Concept (pg. 143)
- Over 100,000 years ago, at the end of the age of demons, the Couatl made their sacrifice and separated the [[Overlords]]' source of power from the material plane, weakening and trapping their avatars in magical prisons around the world. 
- This is the prison of **[[Rak Tulkesh|Rak Tulkesh's]]** power, which is useless without an avatar.

# Description
> As you step past the stone columns that mark the entrance, the world behind you fades away, replaced by a hushed reverence for something incomprehensibly ancient. The air here is warm, and as it feels like pine needles as it rushes past you. It smells of wet stone and dank moss. 

>  A bright, silver fire emanates from a pulsing purple gem, illuminating the temple from the far side of you, casting you in dim light. Thick columns of cracked marble line this place in multiple rows, acting as supports that hold up the vaulted ceiling. Many runes have been chiseled out of the columns, but the wear of time has made them almost completely unreadable. All you can make out is "Temple - Endless - Rage".

> Rows of well kept wooden pews line both sides of a walkway that leads to the flame. As you take in the vastness of this temple, its centerpiece demands your attention. An enormous pit sits 15ft in front of you. Its depth so vast and dark it swallows any light that dare enter it.

> It has a sort of alluring pull to it that gets stronger the closer you get. Almost as if its calling to you, reaching out to your very soul with a single word... "CLOSER".

# Notable Locations
- The Endless: The pit that sits in the middle of this timeless temple is actually the largest entrance to *Shavarath*, the demiplane of **Rak Tulkesh**. Though its not large enough to allow the return of his Avatar, it still exudes an immensely powerful influence over the land nearby.
