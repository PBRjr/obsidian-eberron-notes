## Concept
- One of the major continents on [[Eberron]]. Home to the [[Conclave of Dragons]] and its children sects, and several other groups of "lesser species".

## Description
>  Surrounded by vast oceans and filled with badlands, Argonnessen is more a legend than a place. Most know it exists, and most know it is the land of dragons, but knowledge beyond that is simply hearsay. One thing is known for sure: Those who venture to the land of dragons don't return to tell the tale.

- *Eyes of Chronepsis* - Maintains and enforces the laws of Agronessen

## History
- 60,000 years ago, in the aftermath of the First War, the dragons settled this land as their home
- The **Daughter of Khyber's** ability to corrupt dragons keeps them from moving their settlements to other lands.

## Hooks

- Someone is planning an expedition, and needs the party's services for protection.

## Secrets
- **The Daughter of Khyber** is kept imprisoned here within a massive Khyber shard, waiting to be freed.

### Description

## Travel
### Travel Time
Travel in Sharn can be unpredictable. Residents joke that it takes about an hour to get anywhere, whether it’s just down three levels in the same tower or all the way across town. Of course, skycoaches reduce the time dramatically compared to walking from place to place, and characters who really know their way around (as well as characters who are willing to ask for directions frequently along the way) can get to their destinations more quickly than newcomers who refuse to display their ignorance. 

If it becomes important to know how long it takes to get from one place to another, use the following rules of thumb:

|Mode of Travel and Destination|Travel Time*|
|---|---|
|Foot Travel||
|Destination in same district|3d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|6d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|3d6 × 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|6d6 × 5 minutes|
|Flying Travel||
|Destination in same district|1d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|2d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|1d6 × 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|2d6 × 5 minutes|

- A party can reduce this time by one-half if one character makes a successful DC 15 Knowledge (local) or Gather Information check

- Numbers in parentheses are for magebred horses with the swift breed special quality

#### Shavalant



## Description
> Nestled along a winding dirt road, just south of Lake Galifar, lies a quaint village. As you approach, you notice the rhythmic clinking of tools and the soft murmur of voices emanating from small shops and houses clustered together. A few houses are blackened and charred, and seemed to have partially collapsed. The buildings themselves are worn but well-kept, surrounded by fields of crops, some of which are parsley scattered with workers. The air carries the earthy scent of tilled soil and fresh produce. A large metal water tower stands out like a soar thumb, its network of magical pipes extending from the tower into the ground. If you hold your breath, you can almost hear a low-pitched hum emanating from the thing.

## Underdark

### The Temple of the Endless Rage


# Concept (pg. 143)
- Over 100,000 years ago, at the end of the age of demons, the Couatl made their sacrifice and separated the [[Overlords]]' source of power from the material plane, weakening and trapping their avatars in magical prisons around the world. 
- This is the prison of **[[Rak Tulkesh|Rak Tulkesh's]]** power, which is useless without an avatar.

# Description
> As you step past the stone columns that mark the entrance, the world behind you fades away, replaced by a hushed reverence for something incomprehensibly ancient. The air here is warm, and as it feels like pine needles as it rushes past you. It smells of wet stone and dank moss. 

>  A bright, silver fire emanates from a pulsing purple gem, illuminating the temple from the far side of you, casting you in dim light. Thick columns of cracked marble line this place in multiple rows, acting as supports that hold up the vaulted ceiling. Many runes have been chiseled out of the columns, but the wear of time has made them almost completely unreadable. All you can make out is "Temple - Endless - Rage".

> Rows of well kept wooden pews line both sides of a walkway that leads to the flame. As you take in the vastness of this temple, its centerpiece demands your attention. An enormous pit sits 15ft in front of you. Its depth so vast and dark it swallows any light that dare enter it.

> It has a sort of alluring pull to it that gets stronger the closer you get. Almost as if its calling to you, reaching out to your very soul with a single word... "CLOSER".

# Notable Locations
- The Endless: The pit that sits in the middle of this timeless temple is actually the largest entrance to *Shavarath*, the demiplane of **Rak Tulkesh**. Though its not large enough to allow the return of his Avatar, it still exudes an immensely powerful influence over the land nearby.
