The memory of the betrayal fueled his determination to bring Hrothgar to justice, not only for his own sake but to reclaim the honor and legacy of their people.

### Backstory
Sylas Stormshadow, the enigmatic half-elf warlock of chaotic neutral alignment, has a backstory filled with mystery and the enigmatic presence of the Traveler.

Born to a human mother and an elven father, Sylas's life was marked by a turbulent blend of cultures and a thirst for power. Here is his revised backstory:

Sylas was born in the bustling coastal city of Sharn, where humans and elves coexisted in an uneasy alliance. His father, a reclusive elven scholar, had a fascination with forbidden knowledge and the enigmatic aspects of magic. Sylas's mother was a human merchant who embraced the chaos of the city's underbelly. From her, Sylas learned his first taste of anarchy and rebellion.

From an early age, Sylas displayed an insatiable curiosity for the arcane, an unquenchable thirst for power, and an innate ability to bend others to his will. Though concerned about his son's choices, his father could not deny the potential within him and reluctantly taught Sylas the basics of eldritch magic. Sylas quickly surpassed his father's teachings and delved into darker tomes and rituals, seeking the forbidden secrets that eldritch beings held.

One fateful night, during an illicit ritual deep in the city's labyrinthine sewers, Sylas made a pact with the mysterious and enigmatic Traveler. The Traveler granted Sylas otherworldly powers in exchange for his servitude and adherence to its unpredictable whims. Its motives were always veiled in mystery, and its presence brought chaos and intrigue to Sylas's life.
