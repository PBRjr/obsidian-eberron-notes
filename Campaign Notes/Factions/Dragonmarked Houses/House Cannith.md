Key details about House Cannith:

1. Origins: House Cannith was founded by those who bore the mark of creation, dating back some 2,500 years. During the [[War of the Mark]], House Cannith became a dragonmarked superpower. House Cannith used its significant power and influence to bring together the rest of the Dragonmarked Houses and form the [[Twelve]]

2. Influence: House Cannith has a significant presence in nearly every major city across [[Khorvaire]]. They have established numerous foundries, workshops, and factories where they produce a wide range of magical items, from simple tools to complex warforged constructs.

3. Artifice Mastery: The members of House Cannith are renowned for their skill in artifice and crafting. They have developed unique techniques that allow them to infuse mundane objects with magical properties, making their Gorgon emblem highly sought after by adventurers, nobles, and governments alike.

4. Warforged Creation: One of the most notable achievements of House Cannith is the creation of warforged, sentient constructs designed for warfare. The house played a significant role in the [[Last War]] by supplying armies with these powerful soldiers. Now that their forges in Cyre are lost, their production of warforged solders has supposidely come to a hault.

5. Internal Conflict: House Cannith experienced a major split during the Last War when [[Cyre]] was destroyed in the [[Day of Mourning|Mourning]]. This event led to a division within the house into three factions: [[Cannith West]] (based in [[Aundair]]), [[Cannith South]] (based in [[Thrane]]), and[[ Cannith East]] (based in [[Karrnath]]). These factions often compete with each other for power and influence.

6. Dragonmarked Heirs: The leaders of House Cannith are known as [[Triumvirates]] - three individuals who each represent one faction within the house. These Triumvirates are responsible for guiding the overall direction and policies of House Cannith.

7. Technological Advancements: House Cannith is constantly pushing the boundaries of magical technology. They have developed airships, elemental-powered vehicles, and advanced warforged models. Their innovations have significantly impacted transportation, communication, and warfare in Eberron.

8. Relations with Other Houses: House Cannith has complex relationships with other Dragonmarked Houses. They often collaborate with [[House Orien]] for transportation needs, [[House Jorasco]] for healing services, and [[House Kundarak]] for security measures.
