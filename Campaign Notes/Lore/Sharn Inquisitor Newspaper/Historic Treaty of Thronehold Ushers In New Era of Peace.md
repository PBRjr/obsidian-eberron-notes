The Treaty of Thronehold, a significant document promising to redefine the landscape of Khorvaire, has been signed. This landmark agreement signals the end of the Last War that has plagued our continent for over a century.

The signing ceremony took place in Thronehold Castle, the former seat of Galifar's power. Representatives from each of the twelve recognized nations set aside their bitterness and assembled to formally declare an end to hostilities. 

The Treaty delineates boundaries and acknowledges sovereignty, granting each nation its rightfully earned autonomy. These nations include Aundair, Breland, Cyre - now mournfully referred to as The Mournland - Darguun, Droaam, The Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, The Lhazaar Principalities, The Mror Holds, Q'Barra, The Talenta Plains and Thrane.

The agreement also declares that House Cannith will dismantle Creation Forges across Khorvaire and cease Warforged production henceforth. This clause aims to prevent any future escalation of conflict by stemming the creation of magically manufactured soldiers.

Furthermore, it recognizes Warforged as sentient beings with rights equal to those enjoyed by other denizens of Khorvaire. This groundbreaking recognition marks a progressive step in our continent's history.

However, the treaty leaves several contentious issues unresolved. Notably absent are provisions addressing war reparations or specific terms for demilitarization. Additionally, several regions and factions remain unrecognized by the Treaty; this includes Shadow Marches and Valenar who argue for their sovereignty.

While critics express concerns over these omissions potentially sowing seeds for future conflicts; optimists view this as an opportunity for continuing diplomatic negotiations in a newfound atmosphere of peace.

The Treaty signifies not only an end but also a new beginning – a chance for our war-torn continent to heal its wounds and move towards unity and prosperity. It is indeed a monumental milestone in Khorvaire’s history which we should all cherish cautiously while working towards establishing lasting peace.
