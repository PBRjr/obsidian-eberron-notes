SHARN INQUISITOR

MYSTERIOUS CALAMITIES PLAGUE OUTLYING SETTLEMENTS

In recent weeks, reports of inexplicable devastation have trickled in from several small towns and villages across Breland and neighboring regions. Eyewitness accounts describe scenes of utter destruction, with buildings reduced to rubble and farmlands scorched beyond recognition. Authorities remain baffled by the cause of these incidents, with theories ranging from freak magical storms to rampaging elementals.

"It was like nothing I've ever seen," said Mira Thornhaven, a merchant who narrowly escaped the destruction of Millbrook, a small farming community near the Droaam border. "One moment all was calm, the next... it was as if the very earth was screaming."

House Jorasco healers have been dispatched to affected areas, tending to survivors who speak of an overwhelming sense of rage and despair in the wake of the destruction. King Boranel's court has yet to make an official statement on these events.

In other news, tensions continue to rise in Sharn's lower wards as an ongoing turf war between rival gangs escalates. The City Watch reports an uptick in violence, particularly in the Callestan district.

Meanwhile, Morgrave University has announced a breakthrough in the study of Xen'drik artifacts, with Professor Gellen ir'Korran claiming to have deciphered previously unknown Giant runes. This development promises to shed new light on pre-Galifar history.

Lastly, House Orien has unveiled plans for an expanded lightning rail network, promising faster travel times between major cities. Critics argue the project may disrupt local ecosystems, while supporters hail it as a necessary step for continued economic growth.

Stay vigilant, citizens of Sharn, and remember: The Inquisitor brings you the truth, no matter how strange or unsettling it may be.
