SHARN INQUISITOR
Author: Notum Harek

In recent weeks, reports of inexplicable devastation have trickled in from several small towns and villages across Breland and neighboring regions. Eyewitness accounts describe scenes of utter destruction, with buildings reduced to rubble and farmlands scorched beyond recognition. Authorities remain baffled by the cause of these incidents, with theories ranging from freak magical storms to rampaging elementals.

"It was like nothing I've ever seen," said Mira Thornhaven, a merchant who narrowly escaped the destruction of Millbrook, a small farming community near the Droaam border. "One moment all was calm, the next... it was as if the very earth was screaming."

House Jorasco healers have been dispatched to affected areas, tending to survivors who speak of an overwhelming sense of rage and despair in the wake of the destruction. King Boranel's court has yet to make an official statement on these events.

  

UNDERWORLD UNREST: GANG VIOLENCE SURGES IN LOWER WARDS

Tensions continue to rise in Sharn's lower wards as an ongoing turf war between rival gangs escalates. The City Watch reports anÂ uptick in violence, particularly in the Callestan district.

Sources close to the investigation suggest that the conflict centers around control of the lucrative dreamlily trade, with the Boromar Clan and Daask at the heart of the struggle. Residents report frequent skirmishes and suspicious disappearances, while local businesses suffer from increased "protection" fees. The situation has prompted calls for increased City Watch presence, but critics argue this may only inflame tensions further. Commander Iyanna ir'Talan of the Daggerwatch Garrison assures citizens that "all necessary measures" are being taken to restore order, but declined to provide specifics, citing ongoing operations.
