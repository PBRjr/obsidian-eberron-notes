*It was like thunder inside my skull! -Drel Tulloch, witness*
*Author: Jalana Varan, Special Correspondent*

A tremendous explosion rocked the Callestan district of Lower Dura last night, leaving a warehouse in ruins and citizens scrambling for answers. The building, long suspected by locals to be a processing facility for dreamlily, was reduced to rubble in what authorities are calling a "deliberate attack."  
  
Witnesses report seeing several individuals fleeing the scene just moments before the detonation. Among them was reportedly a hulking warforged, a dragonborn, and several other armed individuals whose identities remain unknown.  
  
"It was like thunder inside my skull," said Drel Tulloch, a tavern owner whose establishment stands across the street from the blast site. "The whole building just lit up purple for a second, and thenâ€”boom! Gone. Nearly took my front door off its hinges."  
  
More concerning are reports that members of the Sharn Watch were present at the scene prior to the explosion. Sources close to the investigation suggest that the notorious Red Cloak Battalion, led by the hobgoblin commander Kazrak the Unyielding, had been conducting surveillance on the facility for several days.  
  
"This has all the hallmarks of an operation gone wrong," commented retired Watch Captain Yorin d'Deneith, who reviewed details of the incident for the Inquisitor. "The timing, the presence of law enforcement, and the complete destruction of evidence point to either spectacular incompetence or something more sinister."  
  
The warehouse was allegedly under the control of the Boromar Clan, whose involvement in the dreamlily trade is one of Sharn's worst-kept secrets. Tensions between the clan and Kazrak's forces have escalated in recent months, with several violent confrontations reported throughout the lower wards.  
  
Most troubling are unconfirmed reports that the explosion was followed by the collapse of a nearby tower section, sending debris raining down into the depths of Old Sharn. The Watch has cordoned off several streets in the area, citing "structural concerns," but has declined to confirm casualties.  
  
City Councilor Killik Roole has demanded a full investigation into the incident: "If the Watch is engaging in vigilante tactics that endanger our citizens, the Council must be informed immediately."  
  
The Boromar Clan has not issued any official statement regarding the explosion, though several known associates have been seen entering and leaving their headquarters in Middle Central.  
  
The Sharn Inquisitor will continue to investigate this developing story.
