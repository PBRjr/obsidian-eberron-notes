In an unprecedented disaster that rocked the City of Towers last night, the notorious floating headquarters of the Boromar Clan plummeted from the skyway into the Callestan district of Lower Dura, killing dozens and leaving hundreds homeless.

The massive airship fortress, long suspected to be the nerve center of the halfling crime family's operations, crashed at approximately 11:47 PM following what witnesses describe as "an explosion of purple light" and the appearance of "some kind of flying monster."

City Watch Commander Iyanna ir'Talan confirmed that both Halak Boromar and his rival Castar were found dead in the wreckage, effectively decapitating the criminal organization that has controlled much of Sharn's underworld for decades.

"This represents a seismic shift in our city's criminal landscape," said Watch Captain Yorin d'Deneith. "We're already seeing territorial disputes breaking out across the lower wards."

**POLITICAL FALLOUT INTENSIFIES**

The disaster has sparked immediate calls for Lord Mayor Cathan ir'Demell's resignation, with City Councilor Killik questioning the administration's failure to prevent such a catastrophe in Sharn's airspace.

"How does a criminal fortress operate openly above our city for years, only to come crashing down on innocent citizens?" Roole demanded during an emergency council session. "This administration has failed in its most basic duty."

The Red Cloak Battalion, an elite unit that had been conducting operations against the clan, suffered significant casualties in the incident. Sources suggest the unit's commanding officer, Kazrak the Unyielding, has been relieved of duty pending investigation.

**ECONOMIC DISRUPTION SPREADS**

The crash site has disrupted lightning rail service and forced the closure of three major shipping warehouses in Lower Dura. House Orien estimates losses in the tens of thousands of galifars, while insurance agents scramble to assess damage claims.

More concerning are reports of violent clashes in the Cogs and Malleon's Gate as rival criminal organizations move to claim former Boromar territory. Daask operatives have been spotted throughout the lower wards, while House Tarkanan safehouses report increased activity.

Local businesses, long subject to Boromar "protection" fees, find themselves caught between relief and uncertainty. "At least we know the devil we're dealing with now," said one tavern owner who requested anonymity.

**INVESTIGATION CONTINUES**

The Sharn Watch has issued warrants for several individuals believed to have been present during the fortress's final moments, though officials declined to provide descriptions citing "ongoing operations."

House Cannith has dispatched investigators to examine what they term "magical anomalies" at the crash site, while the Church of the Silver Flame has offered aid to displaced families.

The King's Swords have been deployed to maintain order as the city grapples with the power vacuum left by the Boromar Clan's sudden collapse.
