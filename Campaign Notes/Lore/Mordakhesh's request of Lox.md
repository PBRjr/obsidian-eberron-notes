*"During your travels you will encounter a... 'thing' that calls itself Vorak." The origin of this creature is of no import, as it is but a shell of its former glory. Normally I would pay no heed to such a disappointment, however within that outer shell lives a... prize. A prize that, should you recover it and bring it to me, may sooth your grief and repair your... broken heart.
*Your patron takes a look to his left, then to his right, as if taking in his surroundings for the first time since you've been here. "Lords, I hate places like this. Its one of mankind's greatest illusions, to build a structure as grand as this out of stone and brick, then claim these structures could stand for a millennia. 'Stone can outlast time itself', they would say.*
*What they don't understand is that its not the stone that gives way, allowing intruders into one's castle. Its the decay of order that destroys civilizations. Because a wall requires maintenance, requires order. Without that, a wall of stone will always decay into nothing but a pile of rocks.*
*Find the creature and return to me what lies within the shell, and you will get your prize.***
