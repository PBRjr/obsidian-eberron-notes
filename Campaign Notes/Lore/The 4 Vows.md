* The Vow of Loyalty
- The Vow of Power
- The Vow of Legacy
- The Vow of Sacrifice

These are the 4 vows that [[Kismet]] originally took when she was chosen to be the last Couatl. Touching each will give a short memory flashback of a moment in Varyn's life.

* Loyalty: Bjorn; Shows Kvitrafn and Varyn standing on the peak of the mountain, Kvitrafn handing Varyn a carving of a wolf. Flashes to Hrothgar's birth, Varyn wearing a necklace with FKD, holding the carving, looking worried. Then flash to him leaving the clan in the middle of the night.
* Power: Draven; Shows Varyn finding Draven at the base of a snowy peak, trying to bring him back, but knowing his memories are gone. 
* Legacy: Shows Geralt's parents visiting Varyn, and him teaching them Sibernyan, filled with hope that they could change things.

After [[Varyn]] chose to not partake in [[The Great Sacrifice]], he formed [[Clan Flameforge]] and ingrained the 4 Vows in its history as pillars to uphold.
