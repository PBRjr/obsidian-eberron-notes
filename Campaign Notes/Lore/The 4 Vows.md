* The Vow of Courage
- The Vow of Purity
- The Vow of Sacrifice
- The Vow of Vigilance

These are the 4 vows that [[Kismet]] originally took when she was chosen to be the last Couatl.

After [[Varyn]] chose to not partake in [[The Great Sacrifice]], he formed [[Clan Flameforge]] and ingrained the 4 Vows in its history as pillars to uphold.
