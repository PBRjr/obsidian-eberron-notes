* The Vow of Loyalty
- The Vow of Power
- The Vow of Legacy
- The Vow of Sacrifice

These are the 4 vows that [[Kismet]] originally took when she was chosen to be the last Couatl.

After [[Varyn]] chose to not partake in [[The Great Sacrifice]], he formed [[Clan Flameforge]] and ingrained the 4 Vows in its history as pillars to uphold.
