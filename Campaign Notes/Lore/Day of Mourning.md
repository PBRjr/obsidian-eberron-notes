The age of demons exposed the world to the power of the Overlords. Great, terrifying, and nearly unstoppable, a single overlord freed of its bonds can assert its domain across an entire country. 

The [[Dragons of Argonnessen]], combined with the full force of the [[Couatl]], waged a war against the [[Overlords]]. Weaving the threads of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], the Couatl sacrificed their collective life force to form the Silver Flame, forever imprisoning the Overlords by separating their consciousness from the power of their Heart Demi planes.

Though they can be imprisoned, the Overlords can never be defeated. In modern times, with the Last War's destruction threatening to plunge the entirety of Khorvaire into chaos, the [[Lords of Dust]] threaten to use the prophecy to break their lords bonds.

After learning the location of the Silver Flame, [[Garick]] led demonic forces into the depths of its containment. Armed with the misleading power granted to him by the [[Steelhardt]], Garick attacked the Silver Flame. It defended itself by releasing a portion of its power, causing the Mourning. The protection mechanisms of the Steelhardt within Garick broke under the awesome power of the Flame's retaliation, corrupting Garick into a rage-fueled killer.
