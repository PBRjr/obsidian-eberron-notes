## In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology
In the intricate tapestry of Eberron's planes, the societal structures of fiends, especially those from the plane of Fernia, the Sea of Fire, exhibit a complexity rivaling that of the most convoluted mortal civilizations. Each fiend, from the minor rakshasas roaming the material plane to the formidable overlords shackled in Khyber, occupies a distinct niche within their fiery domain. This hierarchy, while seemingly rigid, is propelled by a constant undercurrent of ambition and subterfuge, as each entity vies for power, influence, and the opportunity to extend their reach beyond their infernal confines.

Central to the social dynamics of Fernia's denizens is the manipulation of mortal desires and fears through pacts and bargains. These agreements, etched in the essence of the plane itself, are not mere exchanges but pivotal events that can alter the fate of realms. Fiends, with their unparalleled cunning, craft these pacts to ensnare the unwary, trading momentary boons for eternal servitude or influence. Such transactions underscore the fiends' understanding of value, power, and the lengths to which they will go to achieve their ends. Through the lens of these interactions, "In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology" sheds light on the intricate dance of dominance and dependence that defines the existence of Eberron's most malevolent beings.
