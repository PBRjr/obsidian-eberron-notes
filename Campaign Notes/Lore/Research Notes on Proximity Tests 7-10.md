Research Notes on Proximity Tests # 7-10

Subject: Khyber Fragment Exposure Effects on Organic Matter  

Researcher: Professor ir'Torn

  

Test #7: Sunflower seedling placed 10cm from fragment for germination. RESULT: Seedling developed purple veining. Grew 3× normal rate but stems twisted unnaturally. Pollen causes sneezing fits and burning sensation in chest when inhaled.

  

Test #8: Common rat expired 5cm from fragment. RESULT: No observable changes, see Test #8.2.

  

Test #8.1: Common healthy rat placed in tank 5-20cm away from fragment. RESULT: No observable changes.

  

Test #8.2: Expired common rat from test #8 resurrected with Aundarian Institute Approved (AIA) revivify scroll 47 seconds post-expiration. Immediately displayed increased aggression, purple discoloration of eyes. Attacked and consumed cage-mate from test #8.1. Subject breached contamination and was terminated after attempted attack on research assistant.

  

Test #9: Houseplant previously healthy, placed adjacent to the fragment and observed for 20 minutes. RESULT: No observable changes.

  

Test #10: Rat subject born while fragment present in cage. RESULT: Physically normal but demonstrates quickness to agitation. Shows unusual intelligence and problem-solving abilities. Quickly elevates position in social hierarchy when placed with control specimens by ‘encouraging’ other subjects to kill the socially-dominant male of the group. These methods of ‘encouragement’ are not obvious to observers and demand further exploration.

  

CONCLUSION: Fragment demonstrates significant effect on physical and mental states if present for the birth or death/resurrection of a biological organism. Hypothesis: The fragment attaches something to the soul during moments of creation or destruction. Further testing halted pending better containment protocols. Further exploration should focus on these moments of transition, including longer periods of observation.
