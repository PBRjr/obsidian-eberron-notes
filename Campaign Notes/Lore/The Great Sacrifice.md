The age of demons exposed the world to the power of the Overlords. Great, terrifying, and nearly unstoppable, a single overlord freed of its bonds can assert its domain across an entire country. 

The [[Dragons of Argonnessen]], combined with the full force of the [[Couatl]], waged a war against the [[Overlords]] and their armies of the [[Lords of Dust]]. Weaving the threads of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], all but 2 of the Couatl sacrificed their collective life force to form the Silver Flame, separating their conscious avatars from the power of their Heart Demi planes.

Following The Great Sacrifice, the remaining dragons combined forces with the humanoids. Together, they defeated the Overlords, imprisoning each one through various means. [[Rak Tulkesh]] was one such Overlord that was imprisoned. His avatar was sealed inside a great [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard|Khyber Dragonshard]] that was then fractured and spread throughout the world to prevent the Lords of Dust from freeing him from his bonds.
