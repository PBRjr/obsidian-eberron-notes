### Concept

Eberron is a realm of wonder, where magic fuses with technology, creating a world of boundless opportunity and constant conflict. It's a land shaped by the scars of a devastating war, where the lines between good and evil blur, and every corner hides untold stories.

### Description

>Imagine a world where towering cities of shimmering spires rise amidst lush, untamed wilderness. Airships glide through the sky, while lightning rails traverse the vast continents. Eberron is a melting pot of cultures, where mystical creatures coexist with humans in an uneasy balance. The shadows of the Last War linger, casting a somber backdrop to the vibrant life bustling in the streets. Here, ancient ruins lie hidden, holding secrets of forgotten magic, and intrigue weaves through the political tapestry of the land.

### Notable Locations

- **Sharn, the City of Towers**: A vertical metropolis, where the wealthy live in the clouds and danger lurks in the depths.
- **The Mournland**: A haunted, mist-shrouded wasteland, once a thriving nation, now a testament to the horrors of war.
- **Xen'drik**: A mysterious, ancient continent of ruins, holding the secrets of a fallen giant civilization.

### Inhabitants

- **Dragonmarked Houses**: Powerful families bearing mystical marks, controlling major industries.
- **Warforged**: Sentient constructs created for battle, now seeking their place in a post-war world.
- **People of all origins**: Boasting a diverse humanoid population, life in Khorvaire is separated more by nationality rather than ethnicity.

### History

Eberron's history is marked by the cataclysmic Last War, a multi-nation conflict that reshaped the political landscape. The mysterious Day of Mourning ended the war, leaving behind the Mournland and unanswered questions. This history is intertwined with tales of legendary heroes, ancient prophecies, and the ever-present influence of dragons.

### Hooks

- A new invention in Sharn could change the face of magical technology, but someone wants to ensure it never sees the light of day.
- Expeditions into Xen'drik offer riches and ancient magic, but also untold dangers.
- Political tensions rise as the anniversary of the Last War approaches, and old wounds threaten to reopen.

### Secrets

- The true cause of the Day of Mourning remains hidden, with factions seeking to either reveal or bury this knowledge.
- An ancient evil stirs in the depths of Khyber, threatening to unleash chaos upon the world.
- Hidden alliances and betrayals within the Dragonmarked Houses could alter the balance of power in Eberron.

### Other notes

- Eberron challenges traditional moral dichotomies, offering rich opportunities for complex character development and moral dilemmas.
- The fusion of magic and technology opens up unique narrative and mechanical possibilities for adventures.
