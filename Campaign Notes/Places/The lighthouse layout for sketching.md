### Basement Level
Layout:

- The basement level is a series of interconnected rooms and corridors, with a more labyrinthine layout compared to the upper floors.
- The main staircase from the ground floor leads down to a central hub area in the basement.
- Several passages branch off from the hub, leading to various storage rooms, archives, and the hidden chamber.
- The basement level has a lower ceiling and a more claustrophobic feel, with narrow passages and tight corners.
- Some sections of the basement have suffered structural damage, with cracked walls and partially collapsed ceilings.

Access Points:

1. Main Staircase:
    - The primary access to the basement level is through the main staircase from the ground floor.
    - The staircase is made of stone and descends into the central hub area.
2. Secret Passage:
    - A secret passage can be found behind a movable bookshelf in the library on the ground floor.
    - This passage leads to a narrow tunnel that connects to one of the storage rooms in the basement.
    - Characters may discover this passage through careful investigation or by accidentally triggering the mechanism.
3. Collapsed Floor:
    - In one of the damaged sections of the ground floor, a portion of the floor has collapsed, revealing a hole that drops into a basement corridor.
    - This access point may require characters to navigate the debris and make a controlled descent into the basement level.

Hidden Chamber and Puzzle:

1. Locked Door:
    - The entrance to the hidden chamber is a solid, reinforced door with intricate carvings and a complex locking mechanism.
    - The door bears the symbol of the Silver Flame, along with a riddle or puzzle that must be solved to unlock it.
2. Riddle:
    - The riddle on the door reads: "In the depths of knowledge, the flame's truth resides. Seek the tomes that bind the light, and the path shall open wide."
    - The solution to the riddle involves locating specific books within the library that contain information about the Silver Flame and arranging them in a particular order on a nearby shelf.
    - When the correct books are placed in the right sequence, the door to the hidden chamber will unlock.
3. Secondary Access:
    - In case the characters are unable to solve the riddle, a secondary access point can be found within one of the storage rooms.
    - A hidden trapdoor beneath a stack of crates leads to a narrow, winding passage that connects to the hidden chamber.
    - This secondary access may require characters to navigate tight spaces or overcome additional challenges, such as traps or guardian constructs.
4. Teleportation Circle Chamber:
    - The hidden chamber itself is a circular room with a domed ceiling, similar in design to the library above.
    - The teleportation circle is embedded into the floor at the center of the room, with intricate runic patterns and arcane sigils carved into the stone.
    - Various magical apparatus and focusing crystals are arranged around the circle, used to power and stabilize the teleportation magic.
    - A control pedestal or lectern nearby may contain additional clues or instructions for activating the teleportation circle.

## Needs Development
**Information and Foreshadowing:**

- **Baelen and the Priest:** Leave clear evidence that Baelen and the priest escaped the Lighthouse, such as a partially destroyed teleportation circle or a note mentioning their destination. This will pique the players' curiosity and potentially set them on a path to follow Baelen's trail.

- **Lords of Dust:** While the players may not learn the specific name "Lords of Dust" at this point, they should encounter clear signs that the attackers were demonic or fiendish in nature. This can be achieved through descriptions of the creatures, remnants of their magic, or even unsettling murals or symbols left behind.

- **Church of the Silver Flame:** Emphasize the religious nature of the Lighthouse and the Church's devotion to the Silver Flame. This can be done through religious iconography, murals depicting the Church's history and battles against evil, and even surviving texts or scrolls that detail their beliefs and practices.


**Connecting Plot Points:**

- **Origin of the fragment Baelen carries:** The party may find information concerning how the Silver Flame obtained information on the location of the fragment originally, and how they contacted Baelen as a topic expert on Dragonshards and ancient history.
- **Baelen's research on the fragment:** Maybe the players find a report detailing the fragment's effects on various plants and animals that Baelen has been doing experiments on using the fragment. 
- **Lichdom & Phylacteries:** The players might discover a partially destroyed text about Lichdom and phylacteries. In particular, this research discusses how the study of phylacteries may lead to innovation in eliminating mortality without resorting to undeath.
