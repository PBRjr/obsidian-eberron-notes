**Location:** Hidden deep within a crevasse on the mid-slopes of the Icehorn Mountains.  
**Occupants:** [[Traust Ulfr]] and the Stormpeak Refugees.

## Description

* Some force is pushing the air out towards the threshhold, keeping the storm at bay within the cave.
* The walls are smooth, dark ice, lined with hundreds of alcoves. 
	* Scrimshawed bones -> Some have runic etches & **glow slightly**
* **Empty throne** sits deep in the cavern, carved from bedrock, untouched by the ice
	* If Bjorn sits, he can speak to his cryptic ancestors


## Secrets & Lore
* _Clue:_ A generic `Arcana` or `Religion` check reveals the spirits here are creating a "spiritual static" that blinds scrying magic. They do not recognize [[Plot Web#Hrothgar|Hrothgar]] as kin, effectively making the cave invisible to his corrupted magic.
- **Traust’s Instinct:** [[Traust Ulfr|Traust]] did not find this place by map.
    - _Clue:_ She reveals that when the blizzard started, she heard her husband's voice (Bjorn's father) telling her to "Go to where the wind breathes out."
