## Concept
- The former hub of manufacturing during the Last War, Wroat is now undergoing a massive city-wide labor strike. Citing poor working conditions, continuing emergency war-time pay reductions, and warforged labor exploitation, the employees and employers are locked in their positions with no peaceful resolution in sight. Massive supply shortages are causing tension between multiple groups. With the city now under lockdown until the strike is resolved, peaceful protests may soon turn into violent rioting.

## The Labor Strike

| 1   | My family can't eat 'wartime wages'        |
| 2   | Warforged workers = Living workers         |
| 3   | House Cannith: Rich in gold, poor in souls |
| 4   | War profiteers still profiting             |
| 5   | Same blood, same sweat, same pay           |
| 6   | Residuum exposure = slow death             |
| 7   | Heroes abroad, zeros at home               |
| 8   | The real enemy = factory owners            |
| 9   | Emergency wages for emergency times ONLY   |
| 10  | We forged victory, now forge justice       |
