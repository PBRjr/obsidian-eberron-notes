## Concept
* Destroyed by Vorak in a rage-fueled slaughter
* Red mists permeate the grounds at night, forcing the townsfolk inside when the sun goes down
* The nearby bandit group has been exploiting the situation during the day, robbing and such.


## Features
- Rain-soaked ruins
- Survivors are using brutal methods to stay alive (executing suspected collaborators, hoarding supplies)
- Some survivors have become monsters themselves
