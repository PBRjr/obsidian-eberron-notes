## Concept
- Once the active workshop of Yelena and Norbit Wolfsbane, this place now lies decrepit and abandoned. Despite that, House Cannith still maintains a strong presence here.
- A gift lay behind an impenetrable locked door, that only Geralt holds the key to, left by his parents.
- [[Legacy Stone]]

## Description
- Sits across the road from a brothel > ladies are always tempting the guards
- Two guards stand at doorway > conversation about the twins inside *"That's what the twins are for, dumbass. Fucking rookies."*
- Cannith Sergeant (Human Knave) does rounds on his posts > only one that goes in/out > wears amulet that prevents twins from causing harm

## Notable Locations
### Tunnel Entrance
Accessed by a grate in the floor that leads to an escape tunnel put in by Yelena and Norbit in secret. It is now known and guarded by House Cannith, though this post is regarded as the most boring.
