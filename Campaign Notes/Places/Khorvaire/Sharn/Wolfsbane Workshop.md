## Concept
- Once the active workshop of Yelena and Norbit Wolfsbane, this place now lies decrepit and abandoned. Despite that, House Cannith still maintains a strong presence here.
- An important note and a gift lay behind an impenetrable locked door, that only Geralt holds the key to, left by his parents.
