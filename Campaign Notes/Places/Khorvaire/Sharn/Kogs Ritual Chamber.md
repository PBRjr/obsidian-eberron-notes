RULES
1. The party must reach 5 successes before they get 3 failures.
2. Each success allows them to avoid an automation attack and/or advance to the next room.
3. Rubble & rock constantly falls from above, threatening a total collapse of the cavern.


## Automaton
**Attacks.**
Magnetic pulse & Gear Storm Barrage
- *Magnetic Pulse.* The automaton releases a powerful magnetic pulse that attracts metal objects towards it, including weapons, armor, and machinery parts.
- *Gearstorm Barrage.* The automaton unleashes a torrent of spinning gears and cogs from its body, creating a storm of sharp metal that fills the chamber.

*Seismic Stomp.* The automaton stomps on the ground with tremendous force, causing tremors that destabilize the surroundings and create fissures.

*Antimatter Cannon.* The automaton channels its magical energy to its hand and releases it, unleashing a powerful and focused beam of energy that destroys structures in its path.
