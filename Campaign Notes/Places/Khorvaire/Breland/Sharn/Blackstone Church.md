### Concept
- An ancient bastion of compassion in the chaotic Dragoneyes district, led by the half-orc cleric Brother Garrow

### Description
> The Blackstone Church's dark, Gothic exterior stands out among the chaotic streets of the Dragoneyes District. Its towering spires are visible from afar, rising above the neighboring buildings. As you approach, flickering candlelight spills from the church's arched windows hinting at activity within.

> Pushing open the heavy wooden doors, you enter the candlelit interior of the chapel. The space feels warm and calm compared to the commotion outside. Rows of worn pews face an altar depicting the Silver Flame's purifying fire. At the rear of the chapel, an iron-bound door leads deeper into the church. For now, the main chapel is empty besides a few meditating parishioners, but there are signs of regular use including recently snuffed candles and tracks on the dusty stone floor.

### Inhabitants
- Brother Garrow, the stern but kind-hearted head cleric
- Various clergy, monks, and refugees taking shelter

### History
- Founded before the fall of Old Sharn, it's survived as a sanctuary from the surrounding chaos for centuries
- Both respected and resented by local gangs for providing a safe haven  

### Hooks
- Strange noises and incidents plaguings the church - a haunting or attack?
- Retrieving a donated artifact that gets stolen en route to the church
- Dealing with local gangs harassing refugees on church grounds 

### Secrets
- Secret passages below the church leading into the Depths from its early days providing escape routes

### Other Notes  
- While staunchly following the Silver Flame, this church is open to all seeking shelter regardless of faith or history
