## Overview

Sharn, also known as the "City of Towers," is a thriving metropolis located in the southeast of Khorvaire. It is the largest city in the continent and is known for its magical towers that reach high into the sky, earning its nickname. Sharn is an eclectic city, brimming with different races, cultures, and factions.

## Districts

### Central Plateau
The Central Plateau is the heart of Sharn, housing the city's major political, financial and educational institutions. The district is distinguished by its grand architecture and towering skyscrapers, reflecting the city's magical and technological advancements. It is also home to many of Sharn's elite, with upscale residences and luxurious amenities.

#### Upper Central Plateau
The most prestigious district in Sharn where nobility and wealthy citizens reside. Notable locations include Citadel Tower (home to Sharn’s Watch) and Morgrave University.

#### Middle Central Plateau
This area houses middle-class citizens and various businesses. It's also home to several academies and libraries.

#### Lower Central Plateau
The Lower Central Plateau is filled with markets, shops, taverns, and working-class residences. It's often bustling with activity day or night.

### The Cogs
Located below the city proper, The Cogs are a network of massive tunnels filled with factories and forges. This district houses much of Sharn's industry as well as its poorest citizens.

### Menthis Plateau
An entertainment hub boasting theaters, restaurants, casinos, and sports arenas. The famous Torchfire theatre can be found here.

### Dura
One of the oldest districts in Sharn, Dura is a rough and tumble area home to working-class citizens, immigrants, and a fair share of shady characters. The district is divided into Upper, Middle and Lower Dura.

#### Upper Dura
Upper Dura is home to middle-class citizens and is one of the more stable areas in Dura. It houses a number of schools, small businesses, and residential buildings. Notable locations include Daggerwatch Garrison and Stronghold Park.

#### Middle Dura
Middle Dura is filled with hardworking lower-class citizens, many of whom work in the nearby factories or docks. It's often bustling with activity day or night, with various taverns and markets scattered throughout.

#### Lower Dura
Lower Dura is known for its rough reputation. Rife with crime and poverty, it's home to a large portion of Sharn's underclass. Despite this, it also has a strong sense of community among its residents. The Bazaar district in Lower Dura is well-known for its affordable goods.

### Cliffside
Located on the steep cliffs that edge the city to the south, Cliffside offers breathtaking views but precarious living conditions. Filled with sailors, dockworkers, and those drawn by the allure of adventure or escape from law enforcement.

### Tarvick’s Landing
A major transport hub filled with rail stations, airship docks and warehouses. This district keeps Sharn connected with other parts of Khorvaire both by land and air. Home to a diverse mix of inhabitants from traveling merchants to dock workers.

### The Depths
Below even The Cogs lies The Depths - a place shrouded in mystery & danger that few venture into willingly. Home to ancient ruins & creatures best left undisturbed; this area serves as a reminder of what lies beneath Sharn’s grandeur.

## Points of Interest

### Morgrave University
Founded by Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave, it’s known for its extensive collection of relics and artifacts from all over Eberron.

### Torchfire Theatre 
Home to world-renowned playwrights and actors. It’s a symbol of culture in Sharn where people flock to witness grand performances.

### Citadel Tower 
Headquarters of Sharn’s Watch and base for the city guard. It’s one of the most secured locations in the city.

## Society & Culture

Sharn is a melting pot where cultures from across Eberron mingle. Its residents include humans, elves, dwarves, changelings, warforged - even members of more exotic races like goblins or tieflings can be found here. This diversity is reflected in every aspect of life in Sharn from its cuisine to its architecture.

Despite this diversity though, social inequality runs deep in Sharn with a clear divide between those who live in its soaring towers versus those who dwell beneath them in The Cogs or The Depths. This tension frequently leads to conflicts but also fuels much of the city's vibrant art scene as well as its ceaseless political intrigue.

## Travel
### Travel Time
Travel in Sharn can be unpredictable. Residents joke that it takes about an hour to get anywhere, whether it’s just down three levels in the same tower or all the way across town. Of course, skycoaches reduce the time dramatically compared to walking from place to place, and characters who really know their way around (as well as characters who are willing to ask for directions frequently along the way) can get to their destinations more quickly than newcomers who refuse to display their ignorance. 

If it becomes important to know how long it takes to get from one place to another, use the following rules of thumb:

|Mode of Travel and Destination|Travel Time*|
|---|---|
|Foot Travel||
|Destination in same district|3d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|6d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|3d6 × 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|6d6 × 5 minutes|
|Flying Travel||
|Destination in same district|1d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|2d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|1d6 × 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|2d6 × 5 minutes|

- A party can reduce this time by one-half if one character makes a successful DC 15 Knowledge (local) or Gather Information check

- Numbers in parentheses are for magebred horses with the swift breed special quality
