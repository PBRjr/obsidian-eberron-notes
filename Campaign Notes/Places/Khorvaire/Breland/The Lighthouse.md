AKA ***Castle Arakhain***
## Concept
- The Lighthouse is a well-known research facility and FOB for the Church of the Silver Flame. Recently, it came under attack by Lords of Dust Agents, who are on the hunt for the Fragmented Khyber Dragonshard that Baelen carries.

## Description
> A 1 or 2 paragraph description of the location from the viewpoints of the players, that can be directly read to the players, in the style of Matthew Mercer. Only describe things the players would notice, assuming they don't know anything about the place except for what they would have seen upon initial approach and entrance.

## Notable Locations
#### Main chamber
Four tapestries hang from the grand vaulted ceiling here, depicting the history of the Silver Flame. Though they emanate no signs of magic, they seem to be the only thing left untouched here.

Tapestry 1: The Birth of the Silver Flame

> The tapestry depicts a great battle, with a brilliant silver flame erupting from the center, pushing back the surrounding darkness. Silhouettes of armed figures stand around the flame, their weapons raised.

Tapestry 2: The Sacrifice of the Couatl

> The tapestry shows serpentine creatures with feathered wings arranged in a circle, silver light emanating from their bodies. A dark, menacing presence looms in the background, shattered by a blinding silver radiance.

Tapestry 3: The founding of the Church

> The tapestry portrays a gathering of robed figures, with a tall woman holding a glowing tome at the center. The other figures kneel around her, hands outstretched. In the background, the foundations of a grand cathedral are being laid.

Tapestry 4: The Battle Against the Overlords

> The tapestry depicts a chaotic battle scene, with armored figures bearing the Silver Flame emblem on one side and monstrous creatures on the other. A large, shadowy figure with burning eyes looms at the center of the battle.

## Hooks

## Secrets
 - Knowing that this was the closest safe house Baelen and his guards could be heading to, they attacked, destroying parts of the fortress.
- The LoD agents attacked the castle shortly after Baelen and his guards arrived. All of the knights perished, Baelen and the Priest being the only two that escaped, via a teleportation circle to Sharn, which was cut off from the other side once they used it.
