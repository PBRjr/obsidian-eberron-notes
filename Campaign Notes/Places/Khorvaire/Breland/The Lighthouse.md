AKA ***Castle Arakhain***
## Concept
- The Lighthouse is a well-known research facility and FOB for the Church of the Silver Flame. Recently, it came under attack by Lords of Dust Agents, who are on the hunt for the Fragmented Khyber Dragonshard that [[Professor Baelen ir'Torn|Baelen]] carries.
- Baelen and the Priest managed to escape through a teleportation circle in the basement.
## Locations

#### Main Chamber.
Four tapestries hang from the grand vaulted ceiling here, depicting the history of the Silver Flame. 

Tapestry 1: The Birth of the Silver Flame

> The tapestry depicts a great battle, with a brilliant silver flame erupting from the center, pushing back the surrounding darkness. Silhouettes of armed figures stand around the flame, their weapons raised.

Tapestry 2: The Sacrifice of the Couatl

> The tapestry shows serpentine creatures with feathered wings arranged in a circle, silver light emanating from their bodies. A dark, menacing presence looms in the background, shattered by a blinding silver radiance.

Tapestry 3: The Battle Against the Overlords

> The tapestry depicts a chaotic battle scene, with armored figures bearing the Silver Flame emblem on one side and monstrous creatures on the other. A large, shadowy figure with burning eyes looms at the center of the battle.

Tapestry 4: The Sealing of the Overlord

> The tapestry shows a circle of colorful dragons surrounding a large purple crystal with runic symbols on it. In the background, a desolate and war-worn landscape stretches to the horizon.

Tapestry 5: The founding of the Church (Clan Flameforge)

> The tapestry portrays a gathering of robed figures, with a tall woman holding a large sword with a white-hot flaming blade at the center. The other figures kneel around her, hands outstretched. In the background, the foundations of a grand cathedral are being laid.

- Since the Last War, the Lighthouse has also served as a FOB, allowing for early notification of possible invasion from the west into Thrane.
- Ancient texts and recent research can both be found here, though most of it was destroyed in the recent attack.
## Hooks

## Secrets
 - Knowing that this was the closest safe house Baelen and his guards could be heading to, they attacked, destroying parts of the fortress.
- The LoD agents attacked the castle shortly after Baelen and his guards arrived. All of the knights perished, Baelen and the Priest being the only two that escaped, via a teleportation circle to Sharn, which was cut off from the other side once they used it.
