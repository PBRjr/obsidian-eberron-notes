Tapestry 2: The Sacrifice of the Couatl

> The tapestry shows serpentine creatures with feathered wings arranged in a circle, silver light emanating from their bodies. A dark, menacing presence looms in the background, shattered by a blinding silver radiance.

Tapestry 3: The Battle Against the Overlords

Tapestry 4: The Sealing of the Overlord

Tapestry 5: The founding of the Church (Clan Flameforge)

###### Texts.
*"Ancient Clay Tablets"*
	...and so it came to pass that the Couatl, in their ultimate act of selflessness, bound the Overlord Rak Tulkhesh within the depths of Khyber. His rage, once a tempest that threatened to consume the world, was contained within a prison of their own making. The land trembled as the chains of fate were forged, and the echoes of his fury were silenced for an age. Yet, whispers persist of a prophecy, a time when the seals shall weaken, and Rak Tulkhesh, the Lord of Blades, shall rise again to unleash his wrath upon Eberron..."

*"The Chronicles of the Silver Flame"*
    "In the darkest hour, when all hope seemed lost, the couatls made the ultimate sacrifice. Their essence merged, forming a beacon of pure light - the Silver Flame. Its radiance pierced the darkness, driving back the forces of evil and offering solace to the righteous."

*"On the Ethereal Chains: The Pursuit of Life Beyond Death"*
	"The quest for immortality often leads down a path shadowed by ethereal chains. Ancient scholars posited the existence of a soul's anchor—a phylactery—yet, warned of its tether to undeath. A new school of thought, however, seeks the dawn beyond this twilight. Imagine an ethereal crucible, not for ensnaring the soul in a cycle of undeath, but as a bastion for the living essence. A vessel, perhaps, that might harbor the spark of life eternal, untainted by necrosis. Such are the whispers of alchemists and arcanists alike, dreaming of a future where life knows no end."

*"~~Khyber's Darkness: A Study of the Draconic Prophecy~~"*
    "The fragments of ~~Khyber~~, born ~~from the Dragon Below~~, hold untold power. When ~~united~~ they have the potential to unleash great ~~darkness~~ upon the world. The Draconic ~~Prophecy speaks~~ of a time when the fragments shall align, and the forces of ~~shadow~~ will rise once more."

*"The Argent Grimoire: Teachings of the Silver Flame"*
    "Those who follow the path of the Silver Flame must embody its virtues: courage, sacrifice, and unwavering devotion. Through faith and righteous action, the followers of the Flame become beacons of hope in a world beset by darkness. Their magic, fueled by the Flame's radiance, is a potent weapon against the forces of evil."

*"The Shattered Shard: An Account of the Last War"*
     "During the Last War, the nations of Khorvaire clashed in a brutal conflict that reshaped the face of the continent. Amidst the chaos, a great cataclysm struck: the Mourning. The once-mighty nation of Cyre was consumed by a mysterious mist, leaving only the blasted wasteland now known as the Mournland. The cause of this tragedy remains unknown, but rumors persist of dark magic and forbidden experiments gone awry."

*"The Annals of House Cannith"*
    "House Cannith, bearer of the Mark of Making, has long been at the forefront of arcane innovation. Their creations, from the majestic warforged to the convenience of the Everbright lantern, have shaped the course of history.

*"The Flame's Sacrifice: A Martyr's Tale"*
    "Tira Miron, a paladin of the Silver Flame, faced a terrible choice. To save the world from a great evil, she willingly offered herself as a vessel for the Flame's power. In a blinding flash of radiance, Tira ascended, becoming one with the Silver Flame. Her sacrifice stands as a testament to the depths of devotion and the unyielding spirit of those who serve the Flame."

*"The Mimic: How to Identify a Lurking Threat"*
	Its a mimic.

## History
- This fortress has served as the largest collection of religious histories the CotSF controls. The lighthouse is were their most prestigious scholars and researchers conducted their work, surrounded by books and scrolls.

- Since the Last War, the Lighthouse has also served as a FOB, allowing for early notification of possible invasion from the west into Thrane.

- Ancient texts and recent research can both be found here, though most of it was destroyed in the recent attack.
## Hooks
- X
## Secrets
 - Knowing that this was the closest safe house Baelen and his guards could be heading to, they attacked, destroying parts of the fortress.

- The LoD agents attacked the castle shortly after Baelen and his guards arrived. All of the knights perished, Baelen and the Priest being the only two that escaped, via a teleportation circle to Sharn, which was cut off from the other side once they used it.
