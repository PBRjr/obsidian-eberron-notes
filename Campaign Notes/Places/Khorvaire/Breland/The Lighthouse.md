## History
- Once a sanctuary and signal of safety for shifters and their families, Castle Arakain embodied the culture of its inhabitants when they were at risk of being eradicated.
- During the 50 year *Silver Crusade* wrought by the Church of the Silver Flame, Castle Arakhain was sieged, its walls raised, its people slaughtered. 
- The wicked flames burned so brightly their glow could be seen from neighboring cities and kingdoms. Thus, the place was named "The Lighthouse," serving as a warning to those who aim to stand against the Church in the future.
