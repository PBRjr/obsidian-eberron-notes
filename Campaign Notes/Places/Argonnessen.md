## Concept
- One of the major continents on [[Eberron]]. Home to the [[Conclave of Dragons]] and its children sects, and several other groups of "lesser species".

## Description
>  Surrounded by vast oceans and filled with badlands, Argonnessen is more a legend than a place. Most know it exists, and most know it is the land of dragons, but knowledge beyond that is simply hearsay. One thing is known for sure: Those who venture to the land of dragons don't return to tell the tale.

## Notable Locations
- *The Pit of Five Sorrows* - A massive [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber shard]] containing [[Tiamat]] lays behind magical wards at one of the deepest chasms in Eberron.

## Inhabitants
- *The Conclave* - The governing body of draconic elders
- *[[The Chamber]]* - Interprets the [[Draconic Prophecy]] to engineer certain outcomes
- *Light of Siberys* - Military force that protects the continent and maintains containment of the [[Overlords]]
- *Eyes of Chronepsis* - Maintains and enforces the laws of Agronessen

## History
- 60,000 years ago, in the aftermath of the First War, the dragons settled this land as their home
- The **Daughter of Khyber's** ability to corrupt dragons keeps them from moving their settlements to other lands.

## Hooks
- An ancient artifact is somewhere in the Land of Dragons, and someone will pay a high price for its recovery.
- Someone is planning an expedition, and needs the party's services for protection.

## Secrets
- **The Daughter of Khyber** is kept imprisoned here within a massive Khyber shard, waiting to be freed. 

## Other notes
- The dragons that guard the *Pit of Five Sorrows* hold one of the most honorable positions in Argonnessen, and are summarily executed after their tour of duty to prevent **Tiamat's** corruption.
