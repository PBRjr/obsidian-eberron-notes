AKA ***The Tower of Old***

**Backstory:** This dilapidated, hidden underground tower is surrounded by boiling pools of lava deep below Sharn. Difficult to find, the Shadow's Cradle is far from comforting. Its origin unknown, it was gifted to Woe by his master Mordakhesh as a place to recover and develop his newfound abilities.

### Woe's Journal Entries:

*Moral Questions*
> Mordakhesh speaks of liberation, of breaking the chains that bind us. But what if these new chains are just as strong, just as suffocating? What if this power consumes me, turns me into the very weapon I was built to be?

*Determination*
> I must understand this gift, this curse. I must find my own path, forge my own destiny. For I am no longer just a soldier, no longer just a tool. He shed from me my prison of blood and flesh and made me anew. I am Woe, and I will not be controlled.

*Purpose*
> The orders barked, the battles fought, the endless cycle of war. Was that truly purpose? Or just another form of slavery?

*Greater Good*
> Was it truly for the greater good, or was it just blind obedience to a flawed system?

*You killed them*
> Choosing to sacrifice another man isn't an act of valor or righteousness. It is a shadowed deed, veiled in the guise of necessity, yet it remains nothing less than murder. You killed them. You killed me. You killed us all.
