AKA ***The Tower of Old***

**Backstory:** This dilapidated, hidden underground tower is surrounded by boiling pools of lava deep below Sharn. Difficult to find, the Shadow's Cradle is far from comforting. Its origin unknown, it was gifted to Woe by his master Mordakhesh as a place to recover and develop his newfound abilities.
