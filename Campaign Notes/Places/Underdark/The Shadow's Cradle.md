AKA ***The Tower of Old***

**Backstory:** This dilapidated, hidden lair was Mordakhesh's first haven in the world of Eberron. During the Age of Demons, he used this space as a base of operations, a place to plot his rise to power and forge his destiny as Rak Tulkesh's most trusted lieutenant. Here, he nurtured his ambition, honed his demonic skills, and strategized against the Couatl and their allies.

This safe house was once a functional dwelling, built by a skilled human artisans that were subsequently sacrificed.  Mordakhesh, during his time as a common rakshasha, discovered the abandoned home and took it over, twisting it into his own shadowy refuge. The lair was a testament to his cunning and ruthless efficiency. He used its secret passages, hidden compartments, and arcane enchantments to hide from those who sought to destroy him.

**Current State:** The Shadow's Cradle is now a forgotten, crumbling building, seemingly untouched by the passage of time. Its once-ornate exterior is now covered in grime, its windows boarded up and shattered. A dense thicket of thorny vines has grown around the structure, almost entirely concealing it from view. Those who dare enter the Shadow's Cradle feel a chilling presence, as if a dark energy still clings to its walls.
