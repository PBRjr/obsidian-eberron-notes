AKA ***The Tower of Old***

**Backstory:** This dilapidated, hidden underground tower is surrounded by boiling pools of lava deep below Sharn. Difficult to find, the Shadow's Cradle is far from comforting. Its origin unknown, it was gifted to Woe by his master Mordakhesh as a place to recover and develop his newfound abilities.

### Woe's Journal Entries:

*Moral Questions*
> Mordakhesh speaks of liberation, of breaking the chains that bind us. But what if these new chains are just as strong, just as suffocating? What if this power consumes me, turns me into the very weapon I was built to be?

*Determination*
> I must understand this gift, this curse. I must find my own path, forge my own destiny. For I am no longer just a soldier, a tool. I am Woe, and I will not be controlled.
