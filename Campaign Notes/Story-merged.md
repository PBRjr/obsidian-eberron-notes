## All Arcs

## Arc Setup
Story arcs are set up in a very specific way that is shown below. The idea is that at least one of these arcs is being moved forward every session. This is combined with a more extensive plot web to create a  cohesive and intuitive narrative experience for the players.

If a list under an Arc is numbered, this represents the order of priority, not necessarily the order it will be completed. The plot points towards the top of each list are more significant, while the ones towards the bottom may be less significant to the main plot, and more prone to being changed or discarded.

Each arc has a "completion point" which indicates when that arc will be wrapped up and the next one will begin.

Arcs do not have to be completed in any particular order, and many immediate arcs may be completed before a narrative arc is completed (or even before it becomes the main focus).

##### Immediate Arc
- This is what the players are attempting to accomplish at this moment or in the immediate future.
- Each is generally wrapped up within a few sessions
- Generally can be extrapolated from sub-plots of narrative arcs
- Thought of in terms of short-term, obvious, and achievable goals, like episodes of a TV show
	- Ex.: *Obtain horses to improve travel on the long roads ahead*
	- Ex. 2: *Assist an apothecary that you encountered on your journey*

##### Narrative Arc
- This is what the collective immediate arcs are building towards
- Each is generally wrapped up with their own satisfying and self-contained storylines
- Thought of in terms of seasons of a TV show. Goals are more long-term and may not be immediately obvious to PCs
	- Ex.: *Safely travel around the nation and make it to the City of Towers*
	- Ex. 2: *Figure out why tensions are high in Sharn and fix it.*

##### Campaign Arc
- The overall theme or main arc of the entire campaign
- Built up to by each narrative arc, becoming more obvious as the game goes on
- Completion of this arc marks the end of the campaign
- Should provide a satisfying ending that involves the culmination of everything the PCs have accomplished so far
	- Ex.: *The final fight with the ultimate BBEG*

## Narrative Plot Overview


In the land of Eberron, the balance of power teeters on the brink of chaos. The Silver Flame, a mystical force that has safeguarded the realm for centuries, is missing and slowly burning out. This disappearance, coupled with the threat of the Lords of Dust attempting to free the Overlord Rak Tulkesh, casts a shadow of impending doom across the world. Amidst this turmoil, a group of unlikely heroes emerges, their destinies intertwined by fate and their shared quest to protect their world.

### The Heroes

**Bjorn "Bearwolf" Ulfr**, a proud warrior from the Stormpeak Clan, finds his life shattered when his brother Hrothgar, tainted by a dark dragonshard, usurps his rule. Hrothgar’s corruption plunges their homeland into darkness, forcing Bjorn to gather a new group of allies, united by shared ideals and a common enemy.

**Draven Flameforge**, once known as the Knight of the North, is a legend reborn. Hailing from the Flameforge Clan in the Byeshk Mountains, Draven was trained by Varyn the Valiant, the last of the Couatls. Varyn, burdened by regret and self-doubt, sacrificed much of his remaining power to resurrect Draven after he was killed by Hrothgar. Now, Draven, devoid of his past memories, carries the weight of Varyn’s hopes and the light of Siberys, seeking to hold back the forces of Khyber.

**Geralt Wolfsbane** lives on the edge of civilization near the Whitehorn Woods, haunted by the loss of his parents, who were once brilliant artificers of House Cannith. They fled the House to protect their revolutionary design, the Steelhardt, from being misused. Geralt, driven by a mysterious page covered in ancient Sibernyan runes, seeks to unlock its secrets and uncover the truth about his parents’ work.

**Forge**, the first successful soul-transferred Warforged, is an enigma. Created using the souls of fallen soldiers and an unprecedented balance of Siberys and Khyber aspects, Forge retained his memories and sanity. After escaping House Cannith’s control, he destroyed his creation forge and now carries vital knowledge about the Warforged’s true nature. Hunted by his creators, Forge grapples with the ethical implications of his existence and the potential to create more like himself.

### The Villains

**Vorak**, once a loyal assassin of House Cannith, underwent a dark transformation through the Steelhardt. His failed transfer left him a creature of pure rage, manipulated by Mordakhesh, a lieutenant of Rak Tulkesh. Now, Vorak roams the land, his existence tied to the suffering and rage of those he destroys, perpetuating a cycle of death and resurrection.

**Woe**, a soldier from the Last War, was resurrected by Mordakhesh using a fragment of the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard. Now a Warforged infused with dark power, Woe seeks to reunite the shards, believing it will liberate his new race and exact revenge on those who wronged him.

**Mordakhesh** himself is the architect behind many of the heroes’ woes. As a loyal servant of Rak Tulkesh, he guides Woe and others in a relentless quest to free his master. His manipulations are subtle, his motives shrouded in secrecy, making him a dangerous adversary.

**Hrothgar**, Bjorn’s corrupted brother, wields dark power that plagues the land. His possession of a dragonshard fragment and the Etherseraph, a powerful artifact, has turned him into a formidable foe, threatening the very fabric of their homeland.

### Artifacts of Power

The **Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD)** contains the essence of Rak Tulkesh. Scattered in fragments, it grants immense power to those tainted by its dark influence. Woe, Professor Baelen ir'Torn, and Hrothgar each hold fragments, their fates intertwined by the shard’s corrupting touch.

The **Etherseraph**, crafted by Varyn, is both a weapon and a guide. Its white flame has the power to clear the Mourning’s fog and reveal the path to the Silver Flame’s hidden sanctuary. Once wielded by heroes like Tira Miron and Draven, it now lies in the hands of Hrothgar.

The **Steelhardt**, originally designed by Geralt’s parents, can transfer a soul into a new body, promising immortality. However, without the balance of Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron’s aspects, its use results in madness. The Lords of Dust seek to use it to free Rak Tulkesh, making it a central piece in the unfolding drama.

### Factions and Intrigue

**House Cannith**, led by Marix d'Cannith, is steeped in secrets and dark experiments. Their involvement in the creation of Warforged and the Day of Mourning positions them as a pivotal player in the world’s fate.

The **Church of the Silver Flame**, desperate to locate the missing Silver Flame, collaborates with Baelen ir'Torn to harness the power of the dragonshard fragments. Unaware of the Flame’s true location, their quest is fraught with peril and deception.

The **Boromar Clan**, driven by greed and the promise of power, pursues the dragonshard fragments with relentless ambition. Their actions add another layer of complexity to the already tangled web of intrigue.

### Themes and Questions

As the heroes navigate their quests, they grapple with profound questions about morality, redemption, and the nature of evil. Can those born into darkness find their way to the light? What does it take to redeem oneself after a great failure? Through their struggles, they uncover that most villains are not purely evil but shaped by their justifications and past traumas.

The world of Eberron stands on the edge of a knife. The heroes must forge their paths, facing inner demons and external threats, to protect what remains of the Silver Flame and prevent the release of an ancient evil. Their intertwined destinies and the choices they make will determine the fate of their world.

#### PC: Geralt Wolfsbane
- Yelena & Norbit Wolfsbane
	- Geralt's mother and father
	- Wolfsbane is Norbit's family name
	- They both adopted the d'Cannith name, then later gave it up after they left the house.
- Parents died when he was young
	- Killed by Vorak (prior to transformation) as ordered by Marix d'Cannith.
- Geralt's parents originally created the first designs of the Steelhardt while they were a part of House Cannith
	- It was originally intended to be a way of transferring one's "soul" to a new body, effectively producing immortality.
		- The consciousness was attached to the Steelhardt in a magical ritual
		- It then had to be implanted into a corpse for the consciousness to then take over.
		- They created one prototype, combining a Khyber & Siberys shard in the device
		- It was fully functional as intended, but they never wrote down how they got those two shards to work together.
		- Cannith Artificer's subsequent attempts to combine the shards in new designs always failed.
	- They worked for years refining the designs.
	- Marix, working with the LoD, took an interest in these designs for use in creating a sentient warforged army.
		- Yelena and Norbit found out about Marix's plans and fled House Cannith with all of the designs, hiding with their young son near the Whitehorn Woods.
- Geralt was snooping in his father's office when he found the designs laid out across his desk.
		- Being unable to read them, he stole a page that had 'cool' designs and runes on it, also bearing the Gorgon seal of House Cannith.
		- He still has this page to this day.
		- A part of why he has learnt so many languages was to decode this page, but he was never able to.
			- It is written in an ancient language that his parents spoke, due to their inherent secrecy (**Sibernyan**)
			- Language was prominently spoken by the Couatl.
- One night his parents were murdered in their home by Vorak, who stole the prototype schematics. 
- When his parents were killed, he escaped and fled into the woods. He was about 12. He learned to live off the land and was able to survive.
- He now lives near Shavalant and the Whitehorn Woods.

#### PC: Forge
- Forge was created in the first batch of modern warforged - and the only one that didn't lose his mind due to his new found form. All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.
	- The missing traits being: The soul being transferred MUST have aspects of Khyber & aspects of Siberys fused to the soul to transfer without sanity loss.
	- Forge's Steelhardt used Siberys shards as a conduit. In all other warforged in his batch, only having a Siberys shard wasn't enough, since there was no aspect of Khyber attached to their soul/in the Steelhardt.
	- Hence why Vorak's transfer was tainted as well. His Steelhardt used a Khyber shard conduit, but there was no aspect of Siberys attached to him.
	- Since Forge died in proximity to Lick's father's FKD fragment, an aspect of Khyber attached to his soul, which, in addition to the Siberys Dragonshard conduit in his Steelhardt, meant he retained his memories AND his sanity.
	- This information about the missing traits is not currently known **(Vorak stole most of the schematics, which were scattered in various locations for future quests)
- All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead soldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.
- Forge was a human general of **House Cannith (Or maybe some other affiliation makes more sense?)**
- In a battle during the last war, he sacrificed his and his men's lives in an explosion he set off to overtake the enemy.
	- Lick's father and Woe were in Forge's squad. Forge valued winning the battle/war over the lives of his own men. While Woe and Lick's father were engaged in battle, Forge made the decision to sacrifice himself and his entire squad to blow up and destroy the **target (what was the target/what was this battle being fought for?)**.
	- Woe died close to Lick's father's fragment of the *FKD*, causing an aspect of Khyber to latch onto his soul which allowed him to be resurrected into a Warforged body through Mordakhesh's ritual (more details in Woe's backstory)
- Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and infused into a warforged body. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.
- Near the end of the war, he broke free and, using his skills from his past life, **destroyed his creation forge**.
	- He obtained information on his creation, including the methods that were still being used to create new warforged.
	- **He threatened to go public with that [[forge knowledge handout|info]]? (Knowing he would be unable to destroy all of the forges on his own, he forced House Cannith's hand into signing the Treaty of Thronehold and shutting down all creation forges, ending the production of new Warforged?)(Maybe he didn't go public because in the back of his mind he knew one day he may want to "have children"? See 'character motivation'.** 
- Warforged were not liberated due to the Treaty of Thronehold. This treaty was a political move so that Forge would not go public with the information he holds on Warforged production and ruin House Cannith's reputation.
- Due to the ever-looming threat of blackmail, House Cannith has been hunting Forge ever since his escape, attempting to **capture him for further study (probably to continue to attempt to replicate the traits that allowed him to keep his memories)** and eliminate the possibility of that information ever getting out.
- He was branded with a unique dragonmark on the front of this chest. It contains the House Cannith Gorgan, in addition to markings that read "FORGE 2".
- He learned of **another creation forge in Sharn (How did he find out?)**, explaining his presence outside the lighthouse during his introduction to the campaign in session 5, because he was looking for the teleportation circle inside The Lighthouse.
- ***Character motivation:***
	- Is it unethical to create more in my image? Does that make me a God, or does that make me one of you (normal people)?
#### PC: Sylas Stormshadow (Deceased)
- Father was an Elven scholar focused on forbidden knowledge about magic
- Mother was a human merchant in Sharn's Underbelly
- Learned of eldritch power through his father
- Made a pact w/ the Traveler in the sewers
- Would be randomly taken to a different plane for the Traveler's duties
## Story Plot Pieces
- **Themes**:
	- What makes a person good? 
	- Most villains aren't purely evil, but have their own justifications.
	- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?
	- If one has only known evil since birth, are they redeemable or can they overcome that nature? 

- **Central Tension**: The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh
	- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. 
		- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed
		- The silver flame caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so
		- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world

- **Significant Lore**: The Origin of the Warforged
	- Warforged are the man-made reincarnates of the fallen soldiers in the Last War; Their souls were repurposed as weapons in the war that took their lives once already.
	- The first few batches of Warforged were created without a 'soul' - mindless automatons that had no self initiative or instinct. They were grunts, they followed orders, but on average they were less effective than a typical soldier.
	- Cannith artificers - at the order of Marix d'Cannith - devised a method of transferring the soul of a recently deceased humanoid into the body of a warforged - building on the original *Steelhardt* designs taken from Geralt's parents.

- **Significant NPCs**
	- Varyn "The Valiant" Grayburn
		- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl
		- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame
		- Takes the form of an old man missing his left arm at the shoulder. His true form has a partially missing left wing.
		- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons
			- Directly oppose actions of the Lords of Dust
			- A small group within felt that Clan Flameforge's scope was too narrow.
			- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.
		- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.
			- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.
			- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.
			- The LoD found out and also began a search.
			- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.
			- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.
		- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.
		- He saw the purity and potential within Draven
			- The darkness within the shard never affected him.
		- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:
			- The *Etherseraph*
			- A *FKD* fragment
		- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber

	- Aeren d'Cannith
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To discover the true process of the creation of Warforged and what changed between  the originals and the modern creations.
		- Was adopted into House Cannith about 20 years ago at the age of 18 y/o as the Youngest Master Artificer (and only Master Artificer without a Mark of Creation) ever named within the house.
			- Due to his invention of the ingenious Everbright Lantern
		- He is now the Mentor to Miri, the magewright currently living in Shavelant.
		- He was always very interested in the warforged and their creation.
		- Aeren knew of Geralt's parents before they died, and knew they were very important.
			- He didn't know what they were researching, but he knew it was highly classified.
		- He does not know what Geralt's schematics say, but he knows that they were written in an ancient draconic dialect (**Sibernyan**)
		- He has come across a few pages of his own **(figure to what those pages reveal?)** but has not been able to translate them.

**Artifacts**
- Artifact 1: ***Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD) & Fragments***
	- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.
		- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of their location, and have been hunting them down since.
		- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.
	- Contains imprisoned essence of Rak Tulkesh
	- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted
	- Who has them
		- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment (taken from Lick in session 1)
		- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment (Needs development, where/how did he find it?)
		- Hrothgar: 1 fragment, obtained from Draven when Hrothgar battled and killed him

- Artifact 2: ***Etherseraph***
	- The Etherseraph was crafted by Varyn following the Silver Flame's creation.
	- In addition to a powerful weapon, the Etherseraph is a tool:
		- The white flame of the Etherseraph will clear the fog of the Mourning and light the way to the Gate of the Silver Flame.
		- The Gate is the entrance to the pocket dimension that contains the actual Silver Flame.
	- Over the years, Varyn has gifted it to many people he deemed worthy to carry it, the most notable being Tira Miron, who, years ago, used it to reseal an escaped Overlord and become the Voice of the Silver Flame.
	- Draven Flameforge was another that was trained by Varyn, and gifted the Etherseraph to wield in the name of Siberys.
	- It is now in Hrothgar's possession, obtained when he killed Draven in battle.

- Artifact 3: ***Steelhardt (The Prototype)***
	- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.
	- Geralt's parent knew that the transference would only be successful if balance between all 3 *Aspects of the Progenitors* were maintained.
		- **Siberys's aspect:** Light, Divinity
		- **Khyber's aspect:** Darkness, Impiety
		- **Eberron's aspect:** Materialism, Tangibility
	- Any imbalance of these 3 (like only using a Khyber/Siberys shard without the other) would result in an imbalance of the soul, causing psychosis.
	- Yelena and Norbit created a single prototype that worked fully as intended. They combined Siberys and Khyber dragonshards into the device, which allowed those two aspects to be fulfilled.
		- They never wrote down how they manage to combine those two shards into a single device. All other attempts made by Cannith Artificers have always failed, and only one shard can be installed without the device failing, which has caused psychosis in almost all subjects it was originally attempted on.
		- Cannith artificers developed a work-around to the psychosis issue: They wipe the soul's memories upon transference to the Warforged body.
	- The LoD seek to use a Steelhardt to transfer Rak Tulkesh's essence from the FKD into a living avatar, so that he could be freed from his bonds and reign over Eberron once again (See Woe's plot pieces).

- **Villains**
	- Vorak
		- Vorak was House Cannith's most skilled assassin, loyal to the House for most of his life. Originally a half-elf, he served for over a hundred years until his age forced him out of field work, though he remained a top advisor for covert activities within the House.
		- He was sent by Marix d'Cannith to kill Geralt's parents after they fled House Cannith.
		- Voluntarily underwent House Cannith's and the Wolfsbane's very first attempt at using a Steelhardt to transfer a soul to another body.
		- The transfer was successful, moving Vorak from his original body to a younger, stronger one from a random deceased soldier.
		- While he retained his memories, his mind quickly became plagued with dark thoughts, his grip on reality worsening.
		- He went rogue, and was manipulated by Mordakhesh, who focused Vorak's mind to one objective: destroy the Silver Flame.
		- Bolstered by new dark powers infused into his Steelhardt by Mordakesh, he led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.
			- His attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, turning him into a rage-fueled creature of destruction, and allowing the Silver Flame to defend itself by causing the Mourning.
		- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, feeding off the rage of the survivors, and using it to resurrect himself should he fall in battle. He is fed imaged in his mind by Mordakhesh to keep him focused on attacking his targets.
		- His darkness-infused Steelhardt causes him to achieve quasi-lichdom through unique means:
			- Should his body ever die, his soul will be kept safe in his Steelhardt until it is placed into a new body.
			- The survivors of his onslaughts get the unrelenting urge to find Vorak and kill him, but if Vorak is dead they find the Steelhardt instead.
			- Once one of the survivors finds his Steehardt, rage consumes them, and forces them to plunge the artifact into their own chest, killing them, and allowing Vorak to resurrect through their body.
			- This process can only be stopped through a ritual involving a Siberys Dragonshard

	- Woe
		- Was originally a human soldier fighting in the Last war under his commanding officer, Forge.
		- During a battle, he was locked into a duel with Lick's father, who wore a fragment of the *FKD* around his neck.
		- During this duel, Forge set off an explosion that completed their objective, but also killed Forge, Woe, Lick's father, and most others that were involved in this battle.
		- Woe's proximity to the fragment of the *FKD* during his death caused his soul to be tainted, keeping him in 'Limbo' after death.
		- Mordakhesh - led by the Draconic Prophecy - resurrected Woe in a profane ritual that stored his soul into the *FKD*, fusing it with the essence of Rak Tulkesh, and containing it in a Warforged body.
		- This gave him dark powers, sourced from Rak Tulkesh's essence, which is trapped within. The only limit to his power being the remaining FKD fragments that are still out in the world.
		- Woe's soul, now heavily influenced by the Overlord of Rage, works fanatically under Mordakhesh's guidance.
		- ***Motivation:***
			- Forge's decision to sacrifice himself and all of his men, including Woe, caused Woe to become extremely tribal, going to extreme means to protect any he deems as 'his people', and to destroy any who he perceives as threatening their existence.
			- He seeks to reunite all of the *FKD* fragments and use that power to liberate his newfound race of Warforged, and wipe all who oppose him from the planet.

	- Mordakhesh
		- Lieutenant to Rak Tulkhesh
		- Commands the Lords of Dust & performed ritual on Woe
		- Has been hunting the FKD fragments for a long time
			- Ever since Varyn went looking for them
		- Has been guiding Woe to seek out the *FKD* fragments, telling him they will give him the power to achieve his own goals
		- Mardakhesh has kept a secret from Woe - the reunification of the FKD and its shards will allow Rak Tulkesh to use Woe's soul as a catalyst - destroying Rak Tulkesh's prison and allowing his avatar to once again claim dominion over Eberron, shattering Woe's soul in the process.

	- Hrothgar 
		- Bjorn's brother
		- Usurped Bjorn's position as the Chieftian of the Stormpeak Clan
		- Killed Draven and took his fractured dragonshard fragment and white flameblade, further increasing his power and dark influence on the surrounding land.

- **Factions**
	- House Cannith
		- The leader of Cannith south is Marix d'Cannith.
		- Marix ordered the use of the Steelhardt in the ritual involving Vorack.
		- He also put the hit out on Geralt's parents.

	- Church of the Silver Flame
		- ***Secret***: Doesn't actually know where the Silver Flame is kept.
		- ***Motivation:*** Find the Silver Flame and claim dominion over it, to protect it.
		- Know of the Boromar Clan's attempts to track down Baelin ir'Torn for the dragonshard fragment.

### Arrival at Sharn


**Via lightning rail at Terminus Station.**
As you step off the lightning rail coach, the cacophony of Terminus Station washes over you. The air hums with the energy of a thousand voices, all clamoring, bartering, and calling out greetings or farewells. The station itself is a colossal structure, its high, vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns of dark, polished wood. Enormous everbright lanterns hang from the ceiling, bathing the station in a warm, welcoming glow.

Before you can even take a breath, you're surrounded by a swarm of people. Porters push their way through the throng, their carts piled high with luggage and crates. Skycoach drivers tout the speed and comfort of their vehicles, hoping to lure travelers to their flying chariots. Guides, their faces eager and hopeful, offer their services to help navigate the labyrinthine city. And of course, there are the inevitable beggars, their pleas for alms blending into the general din.

Through the crowd, you can see the many shops and stalls that line the edges of the station. House Orien maintains a strong presence here, with offices for arranging transport and shipping, as well as a small enclave for its heirs. House Sivis has a message station here, and House Deneith has a small outpost where you can hire bodyguards or laborers. House Vadalis even operates a large stable and hostelry, should you need to secure your mounts while exploring the city.

**Via land road at Wroann's Gate.**
As you approach the colossal entrance to the City of Towers, you begin to understand the depth of its name. A breathtaking panorama of soaring spires and towering structures stretches before you, reaching up into the sky as if to pierce the heavens themselves. The sheer scale of the city is overwhelming, and you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.

The gate itself is a marvel of engineering, a massive archway carved from black granite and topped by a titanic statue of Queen Wroann of Breland. The queen holds a scepter in one hand and a sword above her head.

The streets of Wroann's Gate teem with life. Merchants and traders hawk their wares, their voices blending into a cacophony of sound. Travelers from across Khorvaire mingle with the city's residents, their faces reflecting a myriad of cultures and backgrounds. Skycoaches flit through the air like giant dragonflies, carrying passengers to their destinations. And beneath it all, you can hear the constant hum of the Cogs, the beating heart of Sharn's industry.

Crossing the threshold into the impossibly tall city, the first thing that hits you is the smell. It's a complex, ever-shifting blend of a thousand different scents: the tang of smoke and sulfur from the Cogs, the sweet aroma of exotic spices, the stench of sewage and garbage, and the faint but unmistakable fragrance of magic.

The next thing you notice is the noise. Sharn is a city that never sleeps, and the din of its inhabitants is constant. You hear the shouts of merchants hawking their wares, the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the rhythmic clang of hammers in the Cogs, and the distant roar of the crowds in the entertainment districts. It's a noise that can be overwhelming at first, but it's also a noise that pulsates with life and energy.

You're struck by the diversity of the city's inhabitants. Humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and even more exotic creatures all rub shoulders in the crowded streets. You see merchants from the Lhazaar Principalities haggling with traders from the Mror Holds. You see warforged laborers hauling goods alongside halfling teamsters. You see goblin families begging for alms, their faces etched with the hardship of life in the lower wards.

She claims to be a seer, and offers her services in exchange for help.

### Reading of Fate

Bjorn's reading
>  Ahh, the Bearwolf. The storm within you rages, your heart torn between duty and blood. Yes, I feel your fury, one that is matched only by the darkness that taints your brother's soul. And in the tidal forces of your anger lies a riptide of betrayal, confusion, and... grief. In time, he will know your pain, and your anger will be his fuel, for your destiny was forged in flame and storm long ago.

Draven's reading:
> A knight of many names, and yet you've barely begun to rediscover what any of them mean to you. The Knight's own mind betrays him, a Valiant sacrifice your curse and your savior. Your mind is shrouded in mist, your memories hidden to you. Its barely perceivable, but you know something is very wrong. Its as if a subtle noise that was comforting your ear has suddenly been snuffed out, its absence your only hint at its presence. Will the light of Siberys grant you divine clarity? Or has it already killed the knight, his body not yet informed?

Geralt's reading:
> The lost child, a wolf born of oak and stone, bird song and a quiet breeze your comfort, your solace, a second home created out of the destruction of another. The creations of man have ripped so much from you. Yes... I feel anger and disgust. But is it born only from what has been taken from you? Or is part of it from knowing, deep down, that your only chance of discovering why you lost everything lies in the story of your family's still-beating heart?

## Encounters
### Dialogue between 2 kobolds
**Nasally Kobold**: "Hey, did you see Brains? He all twitchy and scribbling again."

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Yeah, he mad 'bout the last bunch. Not right for the big wake-up thing. He say Woe trick us."

**Nasally Kobold**: "He keep saying 'need willing ones.' What that mean? We just grab what Woe give, right?"

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Shh! Don't let Brains hear ya. He think he big thinker, say he got plan. But some say he not know anything."

**Nasally Kobold**: "Bah, just want big fire and boom like in prophecy. Brains better be right, or maybe we find new boss, huh?"
### Brain's mutterances

## Enemy goals
- Want to summon [[Argonnessen#Secrets|The Daughter of Khyber]] by doing a ritual sacrifice of a "*Willing Dragon Kin*".
	- They misinterpreted this as any Dragonborn/Kobolds, not a willing dragon that has to sacrifice itself.
- This sacrifice is a mistaken ancient take on a part of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] that states if a willing dragon kin is sacrificed in a very particular set of circumstances, The Daughter of Khyber will be freed.

### Prophecy Fragment concerning Tiamat
> In the hour when shadows grow long and the moon bleeds its light, the Daughter of Khyber shall stir in her dark slumber. Only then, if the kin of dragons, willing in heart and spirit, offers itself unto the void, shall the chains of the Daughter weaken. Her roar shall echo through the Five Sorrows, and the world shall tremble before her awakening.

### Ritual in the Kogs


Location: [[Kogs Ritual Chamber]]

**Ritual Completion and Dismissal by Mordakhesh**:

- As the ritual concludes, the air thick with arcane energy, Mordakhesh steps back from the altar. He observes Woe, who is still recovering from the procedure. With a slight tone of concern mixed with command, Mordakhesh advises, "Rest now, let the shard’s essence meld with your own. But first, dispose of our uninvited guests." This comment is made dismissively, without even a glance at the party, underscoring their perceived insignificance.

**Woe's Awakening**:

- Woe lethargically sits up, his eyes flashing with newly imbued purple energy. He lazily stretches a hand towards a dormant piece of machinery nearby. As his fingers twitch, a burst of purple energy flows from his hand into the machine, which whirs to life, its mechanical eyes glowing with the same ominous purple.
- He watches with mild interest, a slight smirk on his face, as the machine turns towards the party, ready to attack.

**Combat Dynamics**:

- The enchanted machine, powered by the dragonshard’s essence, aggressively targets the party. Describe the machine’s movements as unnaturally swift and powerful, enhanced by the magical energy.
- Throughout the fight, as the party manages to damage the machine, Woe, with minimal effort, could casually redirect his energy to enchant other machinery in the room to join the fray, each time causing the cavern to rumble ominously.

**Environmental Collapse and Escape Routes**:

- The ongoing battle and the unstable arcane energy cause the cavern to shake violently. Debris falls, blocking the path they originally took while conveniently opening up another route that leads deeper into the maze of the Kogs and possibly exits near an unexpected part of Sharn.
- As the party battles or decides to flee, they notice the structural integrity of the cavern degrading, hinting that staying much longer could be fatal.

**The Magic’s Limit and Woe's Disinterest**:

- If the party manages to distance themselves from the animated machinery, perhaps through clever maneuvering or by making a dash for the new escape route, they'll notice the purple energy begins to fade from the machines, causing them to slow and eventually stop, unable to pursue further.
- Woe assumes the machines have dealt with the party or that they are no longer his problem. He dismisses them from his mind and exits via his own means, perhaps a portal or cloaked in a shroud of shadows, to recover from the ritual’s exertions.

### Conclusion and Aftermath:

- Once safe, the party can regroup and process the sheer power and threat Woe represents. This encounter not only sets up Woe as a formidable foe but also deepens the mystery and danger of what he and Mordakhesh are planning.
- This experience can lead to new objectives, such as finding ways to counteract or dismantle the dragonshard’s influence, or investigating other areas of Sharn that might hold the key to stopping Woe’s machinations.

### Sharn Tension Encounters


Here is a table with some brief encounter ideas for Sharn and related details to help the DM if players investigate further:

| Encounter | Details for DM |
|-|-|  
| A tiefling preacher rants about "end times" while fearful citizens hurry past. | The preacher is a madman named Jorik who claims to receive visions of doom. DC 15 Insight check reveals he seems sincere in his beliefs. |
| Guards question a ragged half-orc about spotting 'Tarks'. | The guards are referring to House Tarkanan agents rumored to be in the area. The half-orc knows nothing. |
| An elf peddles rare demonic tomes from a cart for exorbitant prices. | The elf is a black market dealer named Talian who sells books about devils and demons, including one titled '[[Misc Books and Texts#In the Details An Exploration of Devil Sociology\|In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology]].' |
| A drunk dwarf mutters about the "flame dying out" before being hushed. | He's referring to a secret cult that believes the Silver Flame is fading. DC 13 Persuasion could convince him to share meeting location. |  
| Guards discuss "troubling omens" in hushed tones. | Omens include unnatural fog, aberrant creature sightings, and night terrors afflicting citizens. |
| Strange symbols warn of "ancient lords" and "serpents." | DC 11 Religion or Arcana check identifies them as connected to Overlords of the First Age. |
| An urchin slips a warning about "enemies in masks." | The urchin knows little but has overheard things suggesting shapeshifters or changelings are operating in the city. |
| Cries ring out from a home before a bloodied resident calmly exits. | DC 13 Insight suspects they are under some kind of charm or mind control magic. |
| Guards extinguish blazes sparked by strange green flames. | The flames radiate conjuration magic and have appeared in seemingly random spots around the city. |

## Airship Crash

In the middle of the night the airship is attacked by Woe, a Warforged Lieutenant to [[Mordakesh]], who on the hunt for a fragment of the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard to increase his power, which is fueled by such fragments.

The ship will crash just south of Drum Keep. Captain Marsh's home is a half-day travel west in Shavalant

## Woe & Team
The attacking party consist of 1  and 6 [[Statblocks#Pteranodon|Pteranodons]], with 2 [[Statblocks#Kobold|Kobolds]] riding each except for one, which is ridden by the Kobold Scale sorcerer. 

The attacking 'bandits' will target the strongest people first. Their objective is to bring the ship down. Eventually, Woe will fly in, held aloft by magic, and drop a fireball directly on the Khyber Dragonshard holding the elemental, bringing the ship down in a heap of fire and splinters.

## After the crash
- The crash site is in a forest clearing, with debris and wreckage scattered around. Bodies of crew members and passengers are strewn about.
- Woe is seen tearing taunting Lick, then killing him with swift efficiency and taking his necklace.
- Woe flies off after securing what he was after, leaving the Kobolds to do as they wish.
- There are several kobold warriors scavenging the wreckage for valuables. They are opportunistic and will attack the PCs on sight.
- After 2 encounters, they come to a narrowing in the river where they can spot Captain Marsh being beaten by laughing kobolds.
- Across the river is the sorcerer leader and his remaining 2 Pteranodon riders, holding the captain captive and beating him. They don't notice the PCs initially, but if they aren't stopped quickly they will kill the captain.

### Arrival at Sharn


**Via lightning rail at Terminus Station.**
As you step off the lightning rail coach, the cacophony of Terminus Station washes over you. The air hums with the energy of a thousand voices, all clamoring, bartering, and calling out greetings or farewells. The station itself is a colossal structure, its high, vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns of dark, polished wood. Enormous everbright lanterns hang from the ceiling, bathing the station in a warm, welcoming glow.

Before you can even take a breath, you're surrounded by a swarm of people. Porters push their way through the throng, their carts piled high with luggage and crates. Skycoach drivers tout the speed and comfort of their vehicles, hoping to lure travelers to their flying chariots. Guides, their faces eager and hopeful, offer their services to help navigate the labyrinthine city. And of course, there are the inevitable beggars, their pleas for alms blending into the general din.

Through the crowd, you can see the many shops and stalls that line the edges of the station. House Orien maintains a strong presence here, with offices for arranging transport and shipping, as well as a small enclave for its heirs. House Sivis has a message station here, and House Deneith has a small outpost where you can hire bodyguards or laborers. House Vadalis even operates a large stable and hostelry, should you need to secure your mounts while exploring the city.

**Via land road at Wroann's Gate.**
As you approach the colossal entrance to the City of Towers, you begin to understand the depth of its name. A breathtaking panorama of soaring spires and towering structures stretches before you, reaching up into the sky as if to pierce the heavens themselves. The sheer scale of the city is overwhelming, and you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.

The gate itself is a marvel of engineering, a massive archway carved from black granite and topped by a titanic statue of Queen Wroann of Breland. The queen holds a scepter in one hand and a sword above her head.

The streets of Wroann's Gate teem with life. Merchants and traders hawk their wares, their voices blending into a cacophony of sound. Travelers from across Khorvaire mingle with the city's residents, their faces reflecting a myriad of cultures and backgrounds. Skycoaches flit through the air like giant dragonflies, carrying passengers to their destinations. And beneath it all, you can hear the constant hum of the Cogs, the beating heart of Sharn's industry.

Crossing the threshold into the impossibly tall city, the first thing that hits you is the smell. It's a complex, ever-shifting blend of a thousand different scents: the tang of smoke and sulfur from the Cogs, the sweet aroma of exotic spices, the stench of sewage and garbage, and the faint but unmistakable fragrance of magic.

The next thing you notice is the noise. Sharn is a city that never sleeps, and the din of its inhabitants is constant. You hear the shouts of merchants hawking their wares, the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the rhythmic clang of hammers in the Cogs, and the distant roar of the crowds in the entertainment districts. It's a noise that can be overwhelming at first, but it's also a noise that pulsates with life and energy.

You're struck by the diversity of the city's inhabitants. Humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and even more exotic creatures all rub shoulders in the crowded streets. You see merchants from the Lhazaar Principalities haggling with traders from the Mror Holds. You see warforged laborers hauling goods alongside halfling teamsters. You see goblin families begging for alms, their faces etched with the hardship of life in the lower wards.

She claims to be a seer, and offers her services in exchange for help.

### Reading of Fate

Bjorn's reading
>  Ahh, the Bearwolf. The storm within you rages, your heart torn between duty and blood. Yes, I feel your fury, one that is matched only by the darkness that taints your brother's soul. And in the tidal forces of your anger lies a riptide of betrayal, confusion, and... grief. In time, he will know your pain, and your anger will be his fuel, for your destiny was forged in flame and storm long ago.

Draven's reading:
> A knight of many names, and yet you've barely begun to rediscover what any of them mean to you. The Knight's own mind betrays him, a Valiant sacrifice your curse and your savior. Your mind is shrouded in mist, your memories hidden to you. Its barely perceivable, but you know something is very wrong. Its as if a subtle noise that was comforting your ear has suddenly been snuffed out, its absence your only hint at its presence. Will the light of Siberys grant you divine clarity? Or has it already killed the knight, his body not yet informed?

Geralt's reading:
> The lost child, a wolf born of oak and stone, bird song and a quiet breeze your comfort, your solace, a second home created out of the destruction of another. The creations of man have ripped so much from you. Yes... I feel anger and disgust. But is it born only from what has been taken from you? Or is part of it from knowing, deep down, that your only chance of discovering why you lost everything lies in the story of your family's still-beating heart?

## Encounters
### Dialogue between 2 kobolds
**Nasally Kobold**: "Hey, did you see Brains? He all twitchy and scribbling again."

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Yeah, he mad 'bout the last bunch. Not right for the big wake-up thing. He say Woe trick us."

**Nasally Kobold**: "He keep saying 'need willing ones.' What that mean? We just grab what Woe give, right?"

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Shh! Don't let Brains hear ya. He think he big thinker, say he got plan. But some say he not know anything."

**Nasally Kobold**: "Bah, just want big fire and boom like in prophecy. Brains better be right, or maybe we find new boss, huh?"
### Brain's mutterances

## Enemy goals
- Want to summon [[Argonnessen#Secrets|The Daughter of Khyber]] by doing a ritual sacrifice of a "*Willing Dragon Kin*".
	- They misinterpreted this as any Dragonborn/Kobolds, not a willing dragon that has to sacrifice itself.
- This sacrifice is a mistaken ancient take on a part of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] that states if a willing dragon kin is sacrificed in a very particular set of circumstances, The Daughter of Khyber will be freed.

### Prophecy Fragment concerning Tiamat
> In the hour when shadows grow long and the moon bleeds its light, the Daughter of Khyber shall stir in her dark slumber. Only then, if the kin of dragons, willing in heart and spirit, offers itself unto the void, shall the chains of the Daughter weaken. Her roar shall echo through the Five Sorrows, and the world shall tremble before her awakening.

### Ritual in the Kogs


Location: [[Kogs Ritual Chamber]]

**Ritual Completion and Dismissal by Mordakhesh**:

- As the ritual concludes, the air thick with arcane energy, Mordakhesh steps back from the altar. He observes Woe, who is still recovering from the procedure. With a slight tone of concern mixed with command, Mordakhesh advises, "Rest now, let the shard’s essence meld with your own. But first, dispose of our uninvited guests." This comment is made dismissively, without even a glance at the party, underscoring their perceived insignificance.

**Woe's Awakening**:

- Woe lethargically sits up, his eyes flashing with newly imbued purple energy. He lazily stretches a hand towards a dormant piece of machinery nearby. As his fingers twitch, a burst of purple energy flows from his hand into the machine, which whirs to life, its mechanical eyes glowing with the same ominous purple.
- He watches with mild interest, a slight smirk on his face, as the machine turns towards the party, ready to attack.

**Combat Dynamics**:

- The enchanted machine, powered by the dragonshard’s essence, aggressively targets the party. Describe the machine’s movements as unnaturally swift and powerful, enhanced by the magical energy.
- Throughout the fight, as the party manages to damage the machine, Woe, with minimal effort, could casually redirect his energy to enchant other machinery in the room to join the fray, each time causing the cavern to rumble ominously.

**Environmental Collapse and Escape Routes**:

- The ongoing battle and the unstable arcane energy cause the cavern to shake violently. Debris falls, blocking the path they originally took while conveniently opening up another route that leads deeper into the maze of the Kogs and possibly exits near an unexpected part of Sharn.
- As the party battles or decides to flee, they notice the structural integrity of the cavern degrading, hinting that staying much longer could be fatal.

**The Magic’s Limit and Woe's Disinterest**:

- If the party manages to distance themselves from the animated machinery, perhaps through clever maneuvering or by making a dash for the new escape route, they'll notice the purple energy begins to fade from the machines, causing them to slow and eventually stop, unable to pursue further.
- Woe assumes the machines have dealt with the party or that they are no longer his problem. He dismisses them from his mind and exits via his own means, perhaps a portal or cloaked in a shroud of shadows, to recover from the ritual’s exertions.

### Conclusion and Aftermath:

- Once safe, the party can regroup and process the sheer power and threat Woe represents. This encounter not only sets up Woe as a formidable foe but also deepens the mystery and danger of what he and Mordakhesh are planning.
- This experience can lead to new objectives, such as finding ways to counteract or dismantle the dragonshard’s influence, or investigating other areas of Sharn that might hold the key to stopping Woe’s machinations.

### Sharn Tension Encounters


Here is a table with some brief encounter ideas for Sharn and related details to help the DM if players investigate further:

| Encounter | Details for DM |
|-|-|  
| A tiefling preacher rants about "end times" while fearful citizens hurry past. | The preacher is a madman named Jorik who claims to receive visions of doom. DC 15 Insight check reveals he seems sincere in his beliefs. |
| Guards question a ragged half-orc about spotting 'Tarks'. | The guards are referring to House Tarkanan agents rumored to be in the area. The half-orc knows nothing. |
| An elf peddles rare demonic tomes from a cart for exorbitant prices. | The elf is a black market dealer named Talian who sells books about devils and demons, including one titled '[[Misc Books and Texts#In the Details An Exploration of Devil Sociology\|In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology]].' |

| Guards discuss "troubling omens" in hushed tones. | Omens include unnatural fog, aberrant creature sightings, and night terrors afflicting citizens. |
| Strange symbols warn of "ancient lords" and "serpents." | DC 11 Religion or Arcana check identifies them as connected to Overlords of the First Age. |
| An urchin slips a warning about "enemies in masks." | The urchin knows little but has overheard things suggesting shapeshifters or changelings are operating in the city. |
| Cries ring out from a home before a bloodied resident calmly exits. | DC 13 Insight suspects they are under some kind of charm or mind control magic. |
| Guards extinguish blazes sparked by strange green flames. | The flames radiate conjuration magic and have appeared in seemingly random spots around the city. |

### Session 1 Lead-in


 Dried blood cakes Khorvaire like topsoil, giving way to the blooming flowers of greed, selfishness, and violence. Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. 

102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. 

Blood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.

Powerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. 

House Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.

With no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.

Then 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. 

The signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.

Still, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.

Our story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. 

Deckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.

The smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.

A tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. 

Bjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?

- DOES KNOW & WON'T GIVE UP: Bosses name, anything that humiliates him, anything that can be directly used against the clan.
- DOES NOT KNOW: Castar's motives, deeper questions about the workings of the clan.

_Plot Information_
- Seeks to bring the town under Boromar control through protection racket and intimidation. Reason clan wants to control Shavalant:
	- Water tower is a unique piece of magitech - knowledge of workings could be worth good money

Person 2: Orc 1 & 3

- Dumb and strong. Will not succumb to physical torture, can be easily tricked into giving up information.
- DO KNOW: they were told to 'keep an eye' on Garhorn.
- DO NOT KNOW: Much else. Basic info about the clan.

_Plot Information_

- Typical brutes, low knowledge of clan workings, low knowledge of current job. Loyal to Halak Boromar, were sent along with Garhorn as Halak's way of keeping an eye on things.
- Many such 'guards' were sent along with Castar's men as a result of the inner conflict of the Clan

Person 3: [[Its Kismet|Kismet]]

- Will find a way to convince the PCs to have their fates read.
- Appears as small graying half-elf woman, acts a bit crazy.

- A young orc boy that provides light hearted roleplay opportunity and reveals Draven's status as a known hero.

Person 5: Chewy

- The Kobold that was covered in oil in session 2 that escaped and was captured by the gang members. Will be very scared.
- DOES KNOW: SotDoK is a fairly new group put together by Brains in an effort to create his own clan, he was always vague about their rituals, kept information to himself. Demanded a lot from the members.
- DOES NOT KNOW: Who Woe is, why they attacked the airship, why they took Marsh.

_Plot Information_

- Killed Orc 1 and Orc 3 during the encounter.
- They healed and interrogated the captured Kobold, who told them that the Sons of the Daughter of Khyber were a very make-shift and disorganized cult.

	- The party let the kobold escape.
- Let Garhorn and his blink dog Flicker leave alive, along with one of their horses (the one that demanded carrots from Geralt when he used speak with animals).
	- The party did not search Garhorn, he left with his sending stone and special lockpicking set.
	- Garhorn will travel to the closest known Boromar safe house and get aid. He used his sending stone to contact his superior and order a hit out on the party. He will also return to Shavalant with more gang members and burn the town to the ground since they aided the party.
	- PCs took the remaining horse from camp (the one that was very thankful for the apple Geralt fed it).

The party returned to Shavalant soon after, and went to talk to Miri.

	- She relays to the party that she spoke with her mentor Aeren d'Cannith, and that he needs the names of the party so he can aid them through the Sharn gates once they arrive.
	- Miri also told the PCs that he was intrigued about Geralt's steelhardt schematics, though he wouldn't reveal anything over sending stone.
	- (Aeren will recognize Geralt's last name and will begin looking into his family further, suspecting they are connected to House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning.)
- Sheriff Cromley showed up at Miri's workshop during this conversation, very irate. He asked the party to leave, and payed for another horse they could ride out of town.
	- He is concered for the same reasons Miri is, though he is less grateful towards the party than her.
- The PCs stopped by Prissy's apothecary on the way out, and she gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth as thanks for delivering news of her son's passing (which happened in session 1).
- They read the intel letter concernig Baelen and his group of CotSF guards and planned on heading to Sharn, with a possible detour to Castle Arakhain (AKA "The Lighthouse") to investigate a potential lead on the purple crystal he has, hoping to discover more about Woe.

During first day of travel they completed the "It's Kismet" encounter.
- Helped her repair her wagon using some glue she had.
- She announced herself as a seer and offered palm readings. Things got weird fast and she gave their fate readings detailed in the encounter.
- The party left shortly after, a bit freaked out.
- Bjorn was less jolted by the encounter, due to his mother being the Stormpeak Clan's seer.

Found the remains of the skirmish between Baelen's guards and the LoD ambush.
- Found the initial clues about the ambush, investigated the scene a bit.

### Session 1 Lead-in


 Dried blood cakes Khorvaire like topsoil, giving way to the blooming flowers of greed, selfishness, and violence. Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. 

102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. 

Blood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.

Powerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. 

House Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.

With no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.

Then 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. 

The signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.

Still, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.

Our story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. 

Deckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.

The smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.

A tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. 

Bjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?

- Dumb and strong. Will not succumb to physical torture, can be easily tricked into giving up information.
- DO KNOW: they were told to 'keep an eye' on Garhorn.
- DO NOT KNOW: Much else. Basic info about the clan.

_Plot Information_

- Let Garhorn and his blink dog Flicker leave alive, along with one of their horses (the one that demanded carrots from Geralt when he used speak with animals).
	- The party did not search Garhorn, he left with his sending stone and special lockpicking set.

	- (Aeren will recognize Geralt's last name and will begin looking into his family further, suspecting they are connected to House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning.)
- Sheriff Cromley showed up at Miri's workshop during this conversation, very irate. He asked the party to leave, and payed for another horse they could ride out of town.
	- He is concered for the same reasons Miri is, though he is less grateful towards the party than her.
- The PCs stopped by Prissy's apothecary on the way out, and she gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth as thanks for delivering news of her son's passing (which happened in session 1).
- They read the intel letter concernig Baelen and his group of CotSF guards and planned on heading to Sharn, with a possible detour to Castle Arakhain (AKA "The Lighthouse") to investigate a potential lead on the purple crystal he has, hoping to discover more about Woe.

During first day of travel they completed the "It's Kismet" encounter.
- Helped her repair her wagon using some glue she had.
- She announced herself as a seer and offered palm readings. Things got weird fast and she gave their fate readings detailed in the encounter.
- The party left shortly after, a bit freaked out.
- Bjorn was less jolted by the encounter, due to his mother being the Stormpeak Clan's seer.

Found the remains of the skirmish between Baelen's guards and the LoD ambush.

### Race/Class/Alignment
- Goliath Barbarian
- Lawful Neutral
### Background
- Soldier
- Was the Chieftain of the Stormpeak clan in the Graywall Mountains of Droaam
- Was usurped by his younger brother, Hrothgar.
### Backstory
Bjorn-Ulfr was born into the Goliath tribe known as the Stormpeak Clan, a hardy and fierce group that roamed the rugged mountains of the northern lands. From a young age, Bjorn-Ulfr showed signs of great strength and resilience, surpassing even the most seasoned warriors in the tribe. His towering stature and relentless determination earned him the respect of his people, and it wasn't long before he was seen as a natural leader.

As he grew older, Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership qualities became more apparent, and it was clear that he would one day become the chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan. Under his guidance, the clan flourished, becoming a force to be reckoned with in the harsh wilderness. Bjorn-Ulfr's sense of honor and loyalty was unwavering, and he made it a priority to protect his people from external threats while fostering a strong sense of unity among his tribe.

Bjorn-Ulfr had a younger brother, Hrothgar, who was also a formidable warrior but lacked the same moral compass as his older sibling. As the years passed, Hrothgar's ambition and lust for power grew. He became increasingly envious of Bjorn-Ulfr's status and the adoration he received from the clan. Hrothgar's jealousy festered, and he began plotting to usurp his brother's position as chieftain.

One fateful night, Hrothgar betrayed his brother, orchestrating a coup against Bjorn-Ulfr and seizing control of the clan through treachery and deceit. Bjorn-Ulfr, who had always been trusting and believed in the inherent goodness of his people, was taken by surprise. Defeated and cast out by his own brother, Bjorn-Ulfr was left to wander the harsh wilderness alone.

With the betrayal still fresh in his heart, Bjorn-Ulfr embarked on a path of self-discovery and redemption. He channeled his anger, pain, and loss into becoming an even more formidable warrior, delving into the ways of the barbarian to hone his rage. As he roamed the wild, he formed new alliances and built a following of loyal outcasts and like-minded individuals who sought justice and vengeance against the treacherous Hrothgar.

Bjorn-Ulfr's ultimate goal became to confront his brother and restore the rightful order within the Stormpeak Clan. The memory of the betrayal fueled his determination to bring Hrothgar to justice, not only for his own sake but to reclaim the honor and legacy of their people. Under Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership, his ragtag group of followers would stop at nothing to right the wrongs committed by his own flesh and blood and restore his place as the true chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan.

## Geralt Wolfsbane

- Beast master ranger
- Outlander background
## (deceased) Sylas Stormshadow
### Race & Class
- Half-Elf Warlock
- Chaotic Neutral
### Background
- Sage
- Born in the Sharn Underground to an Elvish scholar father and Human merchant mother
- Warlock of the Traveler
### Backstory
Sylas Stormshadow, the enigmatic half-elf warlock of chaotic neutral alignment, has a backstory filled with mystery and the enigmatic presence of the Traveler.

Born to a human mother and an elven father, Sylas's life was marked by a turbulent blend of cultures and a thirst for power. Here is his revised backstory:

Sylas was born in the bustling coastal city of Sharn, where humans and elves coexisted in an uneasy alliance. His father, a reclusive elven scholar, had a fascination with forbidden knowledge and the enigmatic aspects of magic. Sylas's mother was a human merchant who embraced the chaos of the city's underbelly. From her, Sylas learned his first taste of anarchy and rebellion.

From an early age, Sylas displayed an insatiable curiosity for the arcane, an unquenchable thirst for power, and an innate ability to bend others to his will. Though concerned about his son's choices, his father could not deny the potential within him and reluctantly taught Sylas the basics of eldritch magic. Sylas quickly surpassed his father's teachings and delved into darker tomes and rituals, seeking the forbidden secrets that eldritch beings held.

One fateful night, during an illicit ritual deep in the city's labyrinthine sewers, Sylas made a pact with the mysterious and enigmatic Traveler. The Traveler granted Sylas otherworldly powers in exchange for his servitude and adherence to its unpredictable whims. Its motives were always veiled in mystery, and its presence brought chaos and intrigue to Sylas's life.

The Traveler's influence transformed Sylas into a warlock with the power to manipulate time, reality, and fate. But in return, the Traveler would randomly manifest its presence, whisking Sylas away to alternate realities and planes, often leaving him to navigate unforeseen challenges.

## Forge
Forge was once a human general during the tumultuous times of the Last War. Known for his unwavering commitment to victory, he often made decisions that placed strategic objectives above the lives of his own soldiers. In a pivotal battle, faced with overwhelming odds, he made the fateful choice to detonate an explosion that claimed his life along with his entire squad, effectively turning the tide in his side's favor.

After his death, Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith, a powerful faction renowned for their advancements in magical engineering. They were experimenting with the creation of sentient constructs called warforged—living beings made of metal and magic designed for warfare. Forge's soul was infused into one of these new bodies, and unlike others in the program, he retained his memories and sanity. This unexpected outcome puzzled the artificers, who could not replicate the process successfully with other subjects.

Held captive by House Cannith, Forge underwent numerous tests as they sought to understand why he was different. Using his experience and tactical acumen, he eventually orchestrated an escape. In the process, he destroyed the creation forge responsible for his rebirth, dealing a significant blow to House Cannith's operations.

Since his escape, Forge has been on the run. House Cannith is determined to find him, both to prevent any secrets from being exposed and to continue their research based on his unique transformation. Bearing a distinctive dragonmark emblazoned on his chest—an identifier linking him to House Cannith—he moves cautiously, aware that he is constantly being pursued.

Forge grapples with his new existence, questioning what it means to be alive in a constructed body. He contemplates the ethics of creating more beings like himself. Would bringing others into the world as warforged be an act of creation or manipulation? This internal conflict drives him to seek understanding of his own identity and purpose.

Amidst a world striving to recover from the devastation of war, Forge searches for a place where he belongs. He is caught between his past as a human general and his present as a warforged fugitive. His journey is one of self-discovery, as he tries to reconcile his actions during the war with his desire to forge a new path forward.
