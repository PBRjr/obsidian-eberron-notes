## All Arcs

## Arc Setup
Story arcs are set up in a very specific way that is shown below. The idea is that at least one of these arcs is being moved forward every session. This is combined with a more extensive plot web to create a  cohesive and intuitive narrative experience for the players.

If a list under an Arc is numbered, this represents the order of priority, not necessarily the order it will be completed. The plot points towards the top of each list are more significant, while the ones towards the bottom may be less significant to the main plot, and more prone to being changed or discarded.

Each arc has a "completion point" which indicates when that arc will be wrapped up and the next one will begin.

Arcs do not have to be completed in any particular order, and many immediate arcs may be completed before a narrative arc is completed (or even before it becomes the main focus).

##### Immediate Arc
- This is what the players are attempting to accomplish at this moment or in the immediate future.
- Each is generally wrapped up within a few sessions
- Generally can be extrapolated from sub-plots of narrative arcs
- Thought of in terms of short-term, obvious, and achievable goals, like episodes of a TV show
	- Ex.: *Obtain horses to improve travel on the long roads ahead*
	- Ex. 2: *Assist an apothecary that you encountered on your journey*

##### Narrative Arc
- This is what the collective immediate arcs are building towards
- Each is generally wrapped up with their own satisfying and self-contained storylines
- Thought of in terms of seasons of a TV show. Goals are more long-term and may not be immediately obvious to PCs
	- Ex.: *Safely travel around the nation and make it to the City of Towers*
	- Ex. 2: *Figure out why tensions are high in Sharn and fix it.*

##### Campaign Arc
- The overall theme or main arc of the entire campaign
- Built up to by each narrative arc, becoming more obvious as the game goes on
- Completion of this arc marks the end of the campaign
- Should provide a satisfying ending that involves the culmination of everything the PCs have accomplished so far
	- Ex.: *The final fight with the ultimate BBEG*


## TYFYS Arcs
### Current
#### Immediate
- Continue moving towards Sharn
- Encounter at Castle Arakhain (The Lighthouse)
- **Completion Point:** The party clears the castle and discoveres the clues within
#### Narrative
##### Act 1:
- Encapsulates the party's journey to Sharn through the wilderness
- Important story beats:
	- Geralt learns the schematics are written in an ancient celestial dialect
	- The party learns about the Silver Flame's history
	- 
- **Completion point:** The party makes it to [[Sharn]] or decides they have a different, more important objective.

## Story Plot Pieces
- **Themes**:
	- What makes a person good? 
	- Most villains aren't purely evil, but have their own justifications.
	- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?
	- If one has only known evil since birth, are they redeemable or can they overcome that nature? 

- **Central Tension**: The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh
	- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. 
		- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed
		- The silver flame caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so
		- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world

- **Significant NPCs**
	- Varyn "The Valiant" Grayburn
		- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl
		- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame
		- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons
			- Directly oppose actions of the Lords of Dust
			- A small group within felt that Clan Flameforge's scope was too narrow.
			- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.
		- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.
			- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.
			- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.
			- The LoD found out and also began a search.
			- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.
			- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.
		- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.
		- He saw the purity and potential within Draven
			- The darkness within the shard never affected him.
		- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:
			- The White Flameblade
			- The dragonshard fragment
		- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber

	- Aeren d'Cannith
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To discover the extent of House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning
		- Was adopted into House Cannith about 20 years ago at the age of 18 y/o as the Youngest Master Artificer (and only Master Artificer without a Mark of Creation) ever named within the house.
			- Due to his invention of the ingenious Everbright Lantern
		- He is now the Mentor to Miri, the magewright currently living in Shavelant.
		- Aeren knew Geralt's parents for a short time when he was adopted into the House.
		- He does not know what Geralt's schematics say, but he knows that they are written in Sibernyan
		- He knows House Cannith had something to do with the Day of Mourning, and is trying to find out more. (needs development: why does he know something is up?)

**Artifacts**
- Artifact 1: ***Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD) & Fragments***
	- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.
		- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of them, and have been hunting them down since.
		- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.
	- Contains imprisoned consciousness of Rak Tulkesh
	- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted
	- Who has them
		- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment
		- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment (Needs development, where/how did he find it?)
		- Hrothgar: 1 fragment, obtained from Draven when Hrothgar battled and killed him

- Artifact 2: ***White Flameblade***
	- Currently in Varyn's possession, obtained when he battled and killed Draven
	- Contains runes that tell of the location of the Silver Flame
		- Unlocks a portal in the Mournland that teleports to Vault deep under Xen'Drik jungle
		- sword was created by Varyn when vault was originally sealed, gave it to Draven
		- Varyn felt useless, saw potential in Draven as a protector
		- Aids in travel through the Mournland, glows blue when pointed in the correct direction

- Artifact 3: ***Steelhardt***
	- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.
	- Worked by attaching a willing soul to a Siberys Dragonshard, then implanting the device into a corpse.
	- Marix d'Cannith & the LoD wanted to use it to create an avatar that could wield Rak Tulkesh's power and destroy the Silver Flame
	- This failed because:
		- It was intended for a consciousness to take over a corpse, not to absorb a great power into a living body
		- The consciousness of an Overlord can never be contained within a Siberys Dragonshard, it is too closely connected to Siberys.
	- Instead, the power of Rak Tulkesh corrupted the shard within the device, along with Vorak's body. While this granted him increased power, it came at the cost of a short life.
	- However, when he attempted to destroy the Silver Flame, the awesome power of the Silver Flame broke the Steelhardt's protection mechanisms, allowing the corrupted power to consume Vorak completely. This gave him a quasi-immortality, similar to Lichdom, but cost him his individuality, turning him into a rage-fueled killer.
	- The only way to destroy Vorak is to complete a ritual that can 'cleanse' the corrupted shard within.
	- It can then be used as a way to 'cleanse' Woe?
		- It was made to store a consciousness, so it can be used to steal Rak Tulkesh's consciousness from the Fractured Dragonshard (once the fragments are reunited).

- **Villains**
	- Vorak
		- Underwent ritual before Woe using the Steelhardt and led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.
			- Due to an inherent failure in the Steelhardt, his attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, turning him into a rage-fueled creature of destruction, and allowing the Silver Flame to defend itself with the Mourning.
		- He was sent by Marix d'Clone to kill Geralt's parents after they fled House Cannith.
		- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, feeding off the rage of the survivors, and using it to resurrect himself should he fall in battle.
		- Heart was replaced with the Steelhardt.
			- The survivors get the unrelenting urge to find Vorak and kill him, but if Vorak is dead they find the Steelhardt instead.
			- The rage consumed them, and forces them to plunge the artifact into their own chest, killing them, and allowing Vorak to resurrect through their body.

	- Woe
		- Was killed by Lick's father who was wearing a dragonshard fragment, during a battle in the Last War.
		- He was revived by Mordakesh and the resources of the Lords of Dust.
		- He accepted a deal from Mordakesh to undergo a profane ritual, implanting the main piece of the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard into his chest.
		- This gave him dark powers, sourced from Rak Tulkesh's consciousness, which is trapped within.
		- With the whispers of Rak Tulkesh in his head, he seeks to reunite the shard fragments and use the power to unleash the Overlord upon Eberron once again.

	- Mordakhesh
		- Lieutenant to Rak Tulkhesh
		- Commands the Lords of Dust & performed ritual on Woe
		- Has been hunting the Dragonshard fragments for a long time
			- Ever since Varyn went looking for them

	- Hrothgar 
		- Bjorn's brother
		- Usurped Bjorn's position as the Chieftian of the Stormpeak Clan
		- Killed Draven and took his fractured dragonshard fragment and white flameblade, further increasing his power and dark taint on the surrounding land.

- **Factions**
	- House Cannith
		- The leader of Cannith south is Marix d'Cannith.
			- He was kidnapped and replaced by a shape-shifting agent (AKA Marix d'Clone) sometime before the Steelhardt was completed and used on Vorack.
			- The real Marix is being held? Or is he dead?
		- Marix d'Clone ordered the use of the Steelhardt in the ritual involving Vorack.
		- He also put the hit out on Geralt's parents.
		- ***Secret***: Marix d'Cannith was replaced by a LoD shapeshifter several years ago, before the Day of Mourning.
		- (Needs developing: Who is the shapeshifter specifically? What are his motivations?)

	- Church of the Silver Flame
		- ***Secret***: Doesn't actually know where the Silver Flame is kept.
		- ***Motivation:*** Find the Silver Flame and claim dominion over it, to protect it.
		- Know of the Boromar Clan's attempts to track down Baelin ir'Torn for the dragonshard fragment.
		- Are working with Baelen trying to locate the Silver Flame, giving him their resources.

	- Boromar clan

### Arrival at Sharn


**Via lightning rail at Terminus Station.**
As you step off the lightning rail coach, the cacophony of Terminus Station washes over you. The air hums with the energy of a thousand voices, all clamoring, bartering, and calling out greetings or farewells. The station itself is a colossal structure, its high, vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns of dark, polished wood. Enormous everbright lanterns hang from the ceiling, bathing the station in a warm, welcoming glow.

Before you can even take a breath, you're surrounded by a swarm of people. Porters push their way through the throng, their carts piled high with luggage and crates. Skycoach drivers tout the speed and comfort of their vehicles, hoping to lure travelers to their flying chariots. Guides, their faces eager and hopeful, offer their services to help navigate the labyrinthine city. And of course, there are the inevitable beggars, their pleas for alms blending into the general din.

Through the crowd, you can see the many shops and stalls that line the edges of the station. House Orien maintains a strong presence here, with offices for arranging transport and shipping, as well as a small enclave for its heirs. House Sivis has a message station here, and House Deneith has a small outpost where you can hire bodyguards or laborers. House Vadalis even operates a large stable and hostelry, should you need to secure your mounts while exploring the city.

**Via land road at Wroann's Gate.**
As you approach the colossal entrance to the City of Towers, you begin to understand the depth of its name. A breathtaking panorama of soaring spires and towering structures stretches before you, reaching up into the sky as if to pierce the heavens themselves. The sheer scale of the city is overwhelming, and you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.

The gate itself is a marvel of engineering, a massive archway carved from black granite and topped by a titanic statue of Queen Wroann of Breland. The queen holds a scepter in one hand and a sword above her head.

The streets of Wroann's Gate teem with life. Merchants and traders hawk their wares, their voices blending into a cacophony of sound. Travelers from across Khorvaire mingle with the city's residents, their faces reflecting a myriad of cultures and backgrounds. Skycoaches flit through the air like giant dragonflies, carrying passengers to their destinations. And beneath it all, you can hear the constant hum of the Cogs, the beating heart of Sharn's industry.

Crossing the threshold into the impossibly tall city, the first thing that hits you is the smell. It's a complex, ever-shifting blend of a thousand different scents: the tang of smoke and sulfur from the Cogs, the sweet aroma of exotic spices, the stench of sewage and garbage, and the faint but unmistakable fragrance of magic.

The next thing you notice is the noise. Sharn is a city that never sleeps, and the din of its inhabitants is constant. You hear the shouts of merchants hawking their wares, the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the rhythmic clang of hammers in the Cogs, and the distant roar of the crowds in the entertainment districts. It's a noise that can be overwhelming at first, but it's also a noise that pulsates with life and energy.

You're struck by the diversity of the city's inhabitants. Humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and even more exotic creatures all rub shoulders in the crowded streets. You see merchants from the Lhazaar Principalities haggling with traders from the Mror Holds. You see warforged laborers hauling goods alongside halfling teamsters. You see goblin families begging for alms, their faces etched with the hardship of life in the lower wards.

She claims to be a seer, and offers her services in exchange for help.

### Reading of Fate

Bjorn's reading
>  Ahh, the Bearwolf. The storm within you rages, your heart torn between duty and blood. Yes, I feel your fury, one that is matched only by the darkness that taints your brother's soul. And in the tidal forces of your anger lies a riptide of betrayal, confusion, and... grief. In time, he will know your pain, and your anger will be his fuel, for your destiny was forged in flame and storm long ago.

Draven's reading:
> A knight of many names, and yet you've barely begun to rediscover what any of them mean to you. The Knight's own mind betrays him, a Valiant sacrifice your curse and your savior. Your mind is shrouded in mist, your memories hidden to you. Its barely perceivable, but you know something is very wrong. Its as if a subtle noise that was comforting your ear has suddenly been snuffed out, its absence your only hint at its presence. Will the light of Siberys grant you divine clarity? Or has it already killed the knight, his body not yet informed?

Geralt's reading:
> The lost child, a wolf born of oak and stone, bird song and a quiet breeze your comfort, your solace, a second home created out of the destruction of another. The creations of man have ripped so much from you. Yes... I feel anger and disgust. But is it born only from what has been taken from you? Or is part of it from knowing, deep down, that your only chance of discovering why you lost everything lies in the story of your family's still-beating heart?

## Sigs
- Marsh is kept inside the cave, mistaken as a 'dragonkin' to be used in a ritual.
- '**The Brains**' - a [[Statblocks#Kobold Dragonshield|Kobold Dragonshield]] that is intelligent *for a kobold* and is the one that made the deal with Woe to help him take down the [[The Airship|Merkentile]]
- This is a faction of Kobolds that worship [[Tiamat]], called the [[Sons of the Daughter of Khyber]]

## In the cave
- Find familiar bodies (**Karnathi Soldiers**, **Orcish Bartender**)
- Traps
- Loot
- Torture devices and corpses
- top level + sublevel
	- Top: main chamber, disposal/trapped corridor and room, Brain's chamber
	- Sublevel: disposal corridor, leading to outside grate. Zombies? Cube?

## Encounters
### Dialogue between 2 kobolds
**Nasally Kobold**: "Hey, did you see Brains? He all twitchy and scribbling again."

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Yeah, he mad 'bout the last bunch. Not right for the big wake-up thing. He say Woe trick us."

**Nasally Kobold**: "He keep saying 'need willing ones.' What that mean? We just grab what Woe give, right?"

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Shh! Don't let Brains hear ya. He think he big thinker, say he got plan. But some say he not know anything."

**Nasally Kobold**: "Bah, just want big fire and boom like in prophecy. Brains better be right, or maybe we find new boss, huh?"
### Brain's mutterances
- "No, no, no... not right, not right. Woe said willing... where find willing? Stupid, stupid!"
- "Prophecy say... blood of willing. But these not willing. Why not work? Brains think, think... must be answer."
- "Others whisper, whisper behind Brains. They think Brains not know... but Brains smartest! Must show them, must prove!"
- "If not get right one, all bad. All bad for Brains. Others get angry, maybe want new leader. No, no, can't let that happen."
## Enemy goals
- Want to summon [[Argonnessen#Secrets|The Daughter of Khyber]] by doing a ritual sacrifice of a "*Willing Dragon Kin*".
	- They misinterpreted this as any Dragonborn/Kobolds, not a willing dragon that has to sacrifice itself.
- This sacrifice is a mistaken ancient take on a part of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] that states if a willing dragon kin is sacrificed in a very particular set of circumstances, The Daughter of Khyber will be freed.

### Prophecy Fragment concerning Tiamat
> In the hour when shadows grow long and the moon bleeds its light, the Daughter of Khyber shall stir in her dark slumber. Only then, if the kin of dragons, willing in heart and spirit, offers itself unto the void, shall the chains of the Daughter weaken. Her roar shall echo through the Five Sorrows, and the world shall tremble before her awakening.
## Treasure
- [[Brains to Woe|Half-written letter]] from Brains to [[Woe]]
- Wand of magic detection (next to a shackled skeleton with no hands)
	- Glows when its near a magic source (always glowing cause it is a magic source)
- Rock of perpetual existing?
- Ring of cold resistance (on the finger of a charred corpse)
- Several potions of healing (on various surfaces next to tortured victims)
- Around 100gp *total*
- Scroll of magic missile

## Marsh
- [[Jonston Marsh (deceased)]]
- Caged in the sublevel, unconscious
- Clothes stripped, in a pile next to him w/ [[Jonston's Note]]

## Next
- [[Shavalant]]
- [[Journey to the City of Towers]]


### Lurking Threat


 - The cover reads "The Mimic: How to Identify a Lurking Threat"
- This book looks like any ordinary book, with a brown leather cover and simple lettering for the title. The book has no listed author.
- A DC 11 investigation check reveals this book has less dust on it than other objects, like it was recently disturbed.

### Sharn Tension Encounters


Here is a table with some brief encounter ideas for Sharn and related details to help the DM if players investigate further:

| Encounter | Details for DM |
|-|-|  
| A tiefling preacher rants about "end times" while fearful citizens hurry past. | The preacher is a madman named Jorik who claims to receive visions of doom. DC 15 Insight check reveals he seems sincere in his beliefs. |
| Guards question a ragged half-orc about spotting 'Tarks'. | The guards are referring to House Tarkanan agents rumored to be in the area. The half-orc knows nothing. |
| An elf peddles rare demonic tomes from a cart for exorbitant prices. | The elf is a black market dealer named Talian who sells books about devils and demons, including one titled '[[Misc Books and Texts#In the Details An Exploration of Devil Sociology\|In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology]].' |
| A drunk dwarf mutters about the "flame dying out" before being hushed. | He's referring to a secret cult that believes the Silver Flame is fading. DC 13 Persuasion could convince him to share meeting location. |  
| Guards discuss "troubling omens" in hushed tones. | Omens include unnatural fog, aberrant creature sightings, and night terrors afflicting citizens. |
| Strange symbols warn of "ancient lords" and "serpents." | DC 11 Religion or Arcana check identifies them as connected to Overlords of the First Age. |
| An urchin slips a warning about "enemies in masks." | The urchin knows little but has overheard things suggesting shapeshifters or changelings are operating in the city. |
| Cries ring out from a home before a bloodied resident calmly exits. | DC 13 Insight suspects they are under some kind of charm or mind control magic. |
| Guards extinguish blazes sparked by strange green flames. | The flames radiate conjuration magic and have appeared in seemingly random spots around the city. |

### 1 Lead-in


 Dried blood cakes Khorvaire like topsoil, giving way to the blooming flowers of greed, selfishness, and violence. Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. 

102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. 

Blood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.

Powerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. 

House Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.

With no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.

Then 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. 

The signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.

Still, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.

Our story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. 

Deckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.

The smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.

A tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. 

Bjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?

### People

Person 1: Garhorn

- Sounds like Billy Butcher. Mid 30's halfling, black hair, polite and manipulative, fiercely loyal to the clan.
- DOES KNOW & WILL GIVE UP: Part of the Boromar clan, sent to create a protection racket, location of valuables.
- DOES KNOW & WON'T GIVE UP: Bosses name, anything that humiliates him, anything that can be directly used against the clan.
- DOES NOT KNOW: Castar's motives, deeper questions about the workings of the clan.

_Plot Information_
- Seeks to bring the town under Boromar control through protection racket and intimidation. Reason clan wants to control Shavalant:
	- Water tower is a unique piece of magitech - knowledge of workings could be worth good money
	- Shavalant is along a commonly traveled road - traveling merchants can be easily extorted.


Person 2: Orc 1 & 3

- Dumb and strong. Will not succumb to physical torture, can be easily tricked into giving up information.
- DO KNOW: they were told to 'keep an eye' on Garhorn.
- DO NOT KNOW: Much else. Basic info about the clan.

_Plot Information_

- Typical brutes, low knowledge of clan workings, low knowledge of current job. Loyal to Halak Boromar, were sent along with Garhorn as Halak's way of keeping an eye on things.
- Many such 'guards' were sent along with Castar's men as a result of the inner conflict of the Clan

Person 3: [[Its Kismet|Kismet]]

- Will find a way to convince the PCs to have their fates read.
- Appears as small graying half-elf woman, acts a bit crazy.

Person 4: Oak Dryfire

- A young orc boy that provides light hearted roleplay opportunity and reveals Draven's status as a known hero.

Person 5: Chewy

- The Kobold that was covered in oil in session 2 that escaped and was captured by the gang members. Will be very scared.
- DOES KNOW: SotDoK is a fairly new group put together by Brains in an effort to create his own clan, he was always vague about their rituals, kept information to himself. Demanded a lot from the members.
- DOES NOT KNOW: Who Woe is, why they attacked the airship, why they took Marsh.

_Plot Information_

- Is proving annoying to the gang members, will be killed before they leave for the day

### Plot Actions

Action 1: Boromar Clan

- Goal: Establish a protection racket in the area
- Garhorn and the orcs are setting up a campsite and gathering information on potential targets for extortion.
- Castar's men are trying to establish control in smaller strategic locations across the continent

Action 2: Lords of Dust

- Goal: Retrieve the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard Fragments
- LoD agents ambushed Baelen's CotSF knight guards, but were defeated. The party may find clues or a surviving agent at the skirmish site. [[Woe]] returned to Mordakesh to have the recently acquired fragment from session 1 merged with his core.

### Additional Notes

- Remember the Ankheg head in the field and decide how it has affected the local area.
- Be prepared for the party's actions to have long-term effects on their relationship with the Boromar Clan and make them known (and possibly wanted) in Sharn.
- Try to indicate the Sons of the Daughter of Khyber are unimportant pawns.

### 4 recap


Raided the boromar gang campsite
- Found Garhorn's ledger, his intel on Baelen ir'Torn, and his map of Khorvaire, in addition to loot listed below.
- Killed Orc 1 and Orc 3 during the encounter.
- They healed and interrogated the captured Kobold, who told them that the Sons of the Daughter of Khyber were a very make-shift and disorganized cult. He also told them Brains struck a deal with Woe to take down the airship in session 1 so they could get more people to sacrifice, though he didn't know Woe's name.
	- The party let the kobold escape.
- Let Garhorn and his blink dog Flicker leave alive, along with one of their horses (the one that demanded carrots from Geralt when he used speak with animals).
	- The party did not search Garhorn, he left with his sending stone and special lockpicking set.
	- Garhorn will travel to the closest known Boromar safe house and get aid. He used his sending stone to contact his superior and order a hit out on the party. He will also return to Shavalant with more gang members and burn the town to the ground since they aided the party.
	- PCs took the remaining horse from camp (the one that was very thankful for the apple Geralt fed it).

The party returned to Shavalant soon after, and went to talk to Miri.
- The townsfolk they passed were quite startled by the party and their appearence due to their recent fight with the gang members.
- Miri was concerned at how they handled it, though she was grateful they helped at all.
	- She is afraid that Garhorn will send for more muscle and come back to burn the town to the ground.
	- She relays to the party that she spoke with her mentor Aeren d'Cannith, and that he needs the names of the party so he can aid them through the Sharn gates once they arrive.
	- Miri also told the PCs that he was intrigued about Geralt's steelhardt schematics, though he wouldn't reveal anything over sending stone.
	- (Aeren will recognize Geralt's last name and will begin looking into his family further, suspecting they are connected to House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning.)
- Sheriff Cromley showed up at Miri's workshop during this conversation, very irate. He asked the party to leave, and payed for another horse they could ride out of town.
	- He is concered for the same reasons Miri is, though he is less grateful towards the party than her.
- The PCs stopped by Prissy's apothecary on the way out, and she gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth as thanks for delivering news of her son's passing (which happened in session 1).
- They read the intel letter concernig Baelen and his group of CotSF guards and planned on heading to Sharn, with a possible detour to Castle Arakhain (AKA "The Lighthouse") to investigate a potential lead on the purple crystal he has, hoping to discover more about Woe.

From a young age, Bjorn-Ulfr showed signs of great strength and resilience, surpassing even the most seasoned warriors in the tribe. His towering stature and relentless determination earned him the respect of his people, and it wasn't long before he was seen as a natural leader.

As he grew older, Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership qualities became more apparent, and it was clear that he would one day become the chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan. Under his guidance, the clan flourished, becoming a force to be reckoned with in the harsh wilderness. Bjorn-Ulfr's sense of honor and loyalty was unwavering, and he made it a priority to protect his people from external threats while fostering a strong sense of unity among his tribe.

Bjorn-Ulfr had a younger brother, Hrothgar, who was also a formidable warrior but lacked the same moral compass as his older sibling. As the years passed, Hrothgar's ambition and lust for power grew. He became increasingly envious of Bjorn-Ulfr's status and the adoration he received from the clan. Hrothgar's jealousy festered, and he began plotting to usurp his brother's position as chieftain.

- Born in the Sharn Underground to an Elvish scholar father and Human merchant mother
- Warlock of the Traveler
### Backstory
Sylas Stormshadow, the enigmatic half-elf warlock of chaotic neutral alignment, has a backstory filled with mystery and the enigmatic presence of the Traveler.

Born to a human mother and an elven father, Sylas's life was marked by a turbulent blend of cultures and a thirst for power. Here is his revised backstory:

Sylas was born in the bustling coastal city of Sharn, where humans and elves coexisted in an uneasy alliance. His father, a reclusive elven scholar, had a fascination with forbidden knowledge and the enigmatic aspects of magic. Sylas's mother was a human merchant who embraced the chaos of the city's underbelly. From her, Sylas learned his first taste of anarchy and rebellion.

From an early age, Sylas displayed an insatiable curiosity for the arcane, an unquenchable thirst for power, and an innate ability to bend others to his will. Though concerned about his son's choices, his father could not deny the potential within him and reluctantly taught Sylas the basics of eldritch magic. Sylas quickly surpassed his father's teachings and delved into darker tomes and rituals, seeking the forbidden secrets that eldritch beings held.

One fateful night, during an illicit ritual deep in the city's labyrinthine sewers, Sylas made a pact with the mysterious and enigmatic Traveler. The Traveler granted Sylas otherworldly powers in exchange for his servitude and adherence to its unpredictable whims. Its motives were always veiled in mystery, and its presence brought chaos and intrigue to Sylas's life.

The Traveler's influence transformed Sylas into a warlock with the power to manipulate time, reality, and fate. But in return, the Traveler would randomly manifest its presence, whisking Sylas away to alternate realities and planes, often leaving him to navigate unforeseen challenges.
