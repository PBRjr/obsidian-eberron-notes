- The party finally gets a moment to rest after escaping the collapse of the HQ and the subsequent destruction of the city below.
- *Exposition.* See people.
- If the party is looking for a way out of the city:
	- The city will be on lockdown while the Sharn Watch searches for those involved in the HQ collapse
	- Aaron knows someone that can get them out. *See people*

- [ ] Encounter 1: *Cannith search party*
	- *If Forge's player is present, this might take place at Aeren's workshop*
	- A group of thugs sent by House Cannith has been tracking the party since they broke into the [[Wolfsbane Workshop]] and is looking for Forge and Geralt.
	- They want Forge due to his backstory as a Cannith creation and his knowledge of the Creation Forges
	- They want Geralt due to the schematics he holds

- [ ] Moment 2: *Glimpse of the Rageblight*
	- News arrives of the Rageblight destroying another village (Galethspyre) that will be on the party's way towards the Byeshk Mountains
	- *OR* the party encounters a refugee of that village that recounts their experiences with the Rageblight
		- This village was Galethspyre, a small fishing village off the Dagger river.

- [ ] Moment 3: *Bjorn's contact*
	- Bjorn's contact is a goliath female that can be found in Lower Dura
	- Her name is *Rutha Rockfist*
		- She can be found frequenting *Marquet's Meat Market* in her free time
		- OR shining shoes during working hours at *Rockfist Boot Booth*
	- She was one of the few that left the clan shortly after Bjorn was usurped, and before Hrothgar could gain power over them. 
	- *Exposition.*
		- The old way to the Mountains has been sealed by Hrothgar, isolating the clan from the outside world.
		- No one has had any contact with the clan for over a year.
		- Those who have attempted to revisit found the nearby land corrupted, haunted by strange and dangerous magical affects/creatures.

- [ ] Moment 4: *Smuggled*
	- Brother Tiron has a contact at House Orion that can smuggle the party out via lightning rail
	- He will stash them in crates and put them into a freight car headed for *Wroat*

- [ ] Session End: *Train Robbery*
	- A group of low-level bandits created an ambush point at a bend in the rail with an obsticle (tree)
	- They board the freight car while the train is stopped, in hopes of robbing a few pieces of cargo.
	- These bandits are from the remaining survivors of a small town that the *Rageblight* devistated.

### Location Details

Place 1: *Name*
- X (brief and relevant to the session)

Place 2: *Name*
- X

(continue as needed)
### People

Person 1: *Aeren d'Cannith*
*Session Information*
- Geralt's parents went to the Byeshk Mountains for *something* that had to do with the Coautl
	- Clues:
		- There are rumors in ancient texts that some believed the last remaining Coautl to live in that area ([[Godlings, Demigods, and Other Mythical Creatures]])
		- Aeren had heard about Geralt's parents taking a trip out there in the past, but always thought it was more of a strange vacation
- The Steelhardt has something to do with transferring consciousness to a new body
	- Clues:
		- The items on [[Yelena and Norbit's Grocery List]] seems unrelated, however the used lich phylactery suggests that the transfer of life is involved
		- The other items seem to be used to somehow stabilize the process, or at least prevent the undeath that accompanies lichdom

Person 2: *Baelin ir'Torn*
*Session Information*
- The fragment is being kept in the artifact room on the upper levels, locked behind a safe
- A warforged with a purple heart and eyes is hunting the FKD fragments
	- He attacked Baelin and his CotSF escort on their return to sharn, though was unsuccessful
	- Baelin is paranoid that he knows where Baelin is at, and that an attack is imminent.
- The fragment is one of many, and it behaves like no other dragonshard he has ever studied before
	- He believes these FKD fragments can corrupt a life form, but only when that life form is born or dies in proximity to the fragment.
		- *Through [[Research Notes on Proximity Tests 7-10|experiments]] on plants and small animals*
			- Flowers wilt and have strange growths when they germinate near the shard
			- Animals are seemingly resurrected immediately after death in proximity, but display increasingly violent and unsettling behavior after.
			- The proximity to the shard doesn't matter once the life form has been corrupted.

Person 3: *Brother Tiron*
*Session Information*
- Brother Tiron is a lowly friar in the CotSF who makes coin on the side as a smuggler
	- He has smuggled illegal ingredients and parts for Aeren d'Cannith in the past
	- He is willing to smuggle the party out of the city for a price
		- He will smuggle them through... the sewers? by lightning rail? Some way that will create another encounter?
- He can be found in *Trader's Bridge* in *Middle Tarvick's Market*

### Plot Actions
