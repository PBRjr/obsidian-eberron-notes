TODO:
* Plan out the path down the channel
	* More underground exploration? What plot gets moved forward?
	* Lox's arc - Mordakesh may try to communicate telepathically with Lox and give him a goal.
		* What's the goal? It must seem insignificant to Lox so he will actually try to accomplish it.
* What plots need to be moved forward this session?
	* Forge's goal to find a creation forge?
* Going down the channel, into the underdark?
	* first it travels down the narrow channel, see "youre being watched"
	* then it opens up, turning into rapids
	* finally stop at a dead end, where the channel continues through small cracks in the cavern wall/ground. A cramped tunnel must be climbed upwards.
	* Tunnel leads up to... Shamukaar
* Shamukaar
	* What/who do they find within? Any answers to their questions?
	* Questions that the party might have: 
		* What do the schematics say? What language are they in?
			* What type of person/monster might have this kind of information here?
		* Who is Woe?
			* A few will have knowledge of him. They will know his name, and that he serves a master/higher power.
	* Woe will have agents planted here, who will attack the party during/after a rest or follow them and attack them once they leave the tavern and return to the surface.
	* The party can use Shamukaar to generally rest and recoup, and to attempt to get answers to questions they might have.
