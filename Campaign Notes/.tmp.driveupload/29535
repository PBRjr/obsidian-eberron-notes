Party infiltrated the castle via the maintenance duct on the bottom floor wearing Boromar disguises
- Nyx turned into a lizard and climbed in through a window and went down to the bottom floor, unlocking the maintenance hatch.

The party started working their way up the castle floor-by-floor
- They found Aeren d'Cannith first and lured the guard wolf away from his door with treats
- They used him as a prisoner for their disguises as they continued searaching the place for Baelin ir'Torn
- Lox used deception and posed as a special weapons officer, telling the AA cannon operators to improperly load the cannons so that when they are fired they explode.

The party peaked into the throne room
- They saw the battle take place between Castar and his men vs Halak and his.
- They left the battle and searched for Baelin, not finding him.

They went to the artifact room and collected some loot
- Some art pieces worth gold
- A valuable diamond worth 1500gp
- A strongbox that they haven't opened, which contains the FKD fragment Baelin had and was studying

They returned to the throne room and witnessed Halak die to Castar's hands.
- They put Aeren into the bag of holding and went to fight Castar and his lackeys and killed them all.
- Bjorn put Halak's and Castar's heads into the bag of holding.
- They found Baelin in the throne room bathroom and put him into the bag of holding, taking out Aeren.

The party was confronted by Woe in the throneroom
* They didn't immediately hand over the FKD fragment
* The party thought he was asking for the [[Legacy Stone]], however he was after the FKD fragment that was in the strongbox, which they don't yet know about.
* Woe and his shadow dragon destoryed the Eberron Dragonshard keeping the HQ afloat, leaving it to topple out of the sky dramatically

Session ended before the HQ falling out of the sky could resolve -- this is where it will pick up in session 16

Next session --> Party is in the Throne room with Aeren, giant hole in the east wall, HQ is beginning to fall, Baelin is in the bag of holding.
