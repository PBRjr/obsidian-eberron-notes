## Day of Mourning

The age of demons exposed the world to the power of the Overlords. Great, terrifying, and nearly unstoppable, a single overlord freed of its bonds can assert its domain across an entire country. 

The [[Dragons of Argonnessen]], combined with the full force of the [[Couatl]], waged a war against the [[Overlords]]. Weaving the threads of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], the Couatl sacrificed their collective life force to form the Silver Flame, forever imprisoning the Overlords by separating their consciousness from the power of their Heart Demi planes.

Though they can be imprisoned, the Overlords can never be defeated. In modern times, with the Last War's destruction threatening to plunge the entirety of Khorvaire into chaos, the [[Lords of Dust]] threaten to use the prophecy to break their lords bonds.

After learning the location of the Silver Flame, [[Varak the Rageblight]] led demonic forces into the depths of its containment. Armed with the misleading power granted to him by the [[Steelhardt]], Vorak attacked the Silver Flame. It defended itself by releasing a portion of its power, causing the Mourning. The protection mechanisms of the Steelhardt within Vorak broke under the awesome power of the Flame's retaliation, corrupting Vorak into a rage-fueled killer, cursed to Lich-dom.

## Draconic Prophecy


> The falling of a tree, the flap of a butterflies wings, the whispers of wind in man's ear. It is not known what drove the universe to create such an eternal living document. That's what unique about chaos - sometimes, things just happen.

## Functionality
The prophecy isn't a document that tells of all that will be. Its more like an observation of specific circumstances that give a series of if-then statements in regard to the universe. Only an ancient or powerful being may have the knowledge to interpret these signs into any useful knowledge.

- [[The Chamber]] actively works to use the prophecy to engineer favorable results in the world.
- The [[Lords of Dust]] actively work to use the prophecy to free their [[Overlords]].

## In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology
In the intricate tapestry of Eberron's planes, the societal structures of fiends, especially those from the plane of Fernia, the Sea of Fire, exhibit a complexity rivaling that of the most convoluted mortal civilizations. Each fiend, from the minor rakshasas roaming the material plane to the formidable overlords shackled in Khyber, occupies a distinct niche within their fiery domain. This hierarchy, while seemingly rigid, is propelled by a constant undercurrent of ambition and subterfuge, as each entity vies for power, influence, and the opportunity to extend their reach beyond their infernal confines.

Central to the social dynamics of Fernia's denizens is the manipulation of mortal desires and fears through pacts and bargains. These agreements, etched in the essence of the plane itself, are not mere exchanges but pivotal events that can alter the fate of realms. Fiends, with their unparalleled cunning, craft these pacts to ensnare the unwary, trading momentary boons for eternal servitude or influence. Such transactions underscore the fiends' understanding of value, power, and the lengths to which they will go to achieve their ends. Through the lens of these interactions, "In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology" sheds light on the intricate dance of dominance and dependence that defines the existence of Eberron's most malevolent beings.

### Historic Treaty of Thronehold Ushers In New Era of Peace


The Treaty of Thronehold, a significant document promising to redefine the landscape of Khorvaire, has been signed. This landmark agreement signals the end of the Last War that has plagued our continent for over a century.

The signing ceremony took place in Thronehold Castle, the former seat of Galifar's power. Representatives from each of the twelve recognized nations set aside their bitterness and assembled to formally declare an end to hostilities. 

The Treaty delineates boundaries and acknowledges sovereignty, granting each nation its rightfully earned autonomy. These nations include Aundair, Breland, Cyre - now mournfully referred to as The Mournland - Darguun, Droaam, The Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, The Lhazaar Principalities, The Mror Holds, Q'Barra, The Talenta Plains and Thrane.

The agreement also declares that House Cannith will dismantle Creation Forges across Khorvaire and cease Warforged production henceforth. This clause aims to prevent any future escalation of conflict by stemming the creation of magically manufactured soldiers.

Furthermore, it recognizes Warforged as sentient beings with rights equal to those enjoyed by other denizens of Khorvaire. This groundbreaking recognition marks a progressive step in our continent's history.

However, the treaty leaves several contentious issues unresolved. Notably absent are provisions addressing war reparations or specific terms for demilitarization. Additionally, several regions and factions remain unrecognized by the Treaty; this includes Shadow Marches and Valenar who argue for their sovereignty.

While critics express concerns over these omissions potentially sowing seeds for future conflicts; optimists view this as an opportunity for continuing diplomatic negotiations in a newfound atmosphere of peace.

The Treaty signifies not only an end but also a new beginning – a chance for our war-torn continent to heal its wounds and move towards unity and prosperity. It is indeed a monumental milestone in Khorvaire’s history which we should all cherish cautiously while working towards establishing lasting peace.


### Mysterious Calamities Plague Outlying Settlements


SHARN INQUISITOR

MYSTERIOUS CALAMITIES PLAGUE OUTLYING SETTLEMENTS

In recent weeks, reports of inexplicable devastation have trickled in from several small towns and villages across Breland and neighboring regions. Eyewitness accounts describe scenes of utter destruction, with buildings reduced to rubble and farmlands scorched beyond recognition. Authorities remain baffled by the cause of these incidents, with theories ranging from freak magical storms to rampaging elementals.

"It was like nothing I've ever seen," said Mira Thornhaven, a merchant who narrowly escaped the destruction of Millbrook, a small farming community near the Droaam border. "One moment all was calm, the next... it was as if the very earth was screaming."

House Jorasco healers have been dispatched to affected areas, tending to survivors who speak of an overwhelming sense of rage and despair in the wake of the destruction. King Boranel's court has yet to make an official statement on these events.

  

UNDERWORLD UNREST: GANG VIOLENCE SURGES IN LOWER WARDS

Tensions continue to rise in Sharn's lower wards as an ongoing turf war between rival gangs escalates. The City Watch reports an uptick in violence, particularly in the Callestan district.

Sources close to the investigation suggest that the conflict centers around control of the lucrative dreamlily trade, with the Boromar Clan and Daask at the heart of the struggle. Residents report frequent skirmishes and suspicious disappearances, while local businesses suffer from increased "protection" fees. The situation has prompted calls for increased City Watch presence, but critics argue this may only inflame tensions further. Commander Iyanna ir'Talan of the Daggerwatch Garrison assures citizens that "all necessary measures" are being taken to restore order, but declined to provide specifics, citing ongoing operations.

Giant Runes and New Routes

Morgrave University has announced a breakthrough in the study of Xen'drik artifacts, with Professor Gellen ir'Korran claiming to have deciphered previously unknown Giant runes. This development promises to shed new light on pre-Galifar history.

House Orien has unveiled plans for an expanded lightning rail network, promising faster travel times between major cities. Critics argue the project may disrupt local ecosystems, while supporters hail it as a necessary step for continued economic growth.

### Skyway's Floating Gardens Flourish with Rare Flora


In a delightful spectacle of nature's resilience, Skyway's floating gardens have become home to a rare species of luminescent flowers, previously thought to be native only to the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. The flowers, known as Starlight Blossoms, have begun to bloom in the high towers of [[Sharn]], casting an enchanting glow over the city's skyline.

The sudden appearance of these flowers has sparked mild curiosity among the citizens and a few scholarly debates in [[Morgrave University|Morgrave University's]] hallowed halls. Botanists are intrigued by how these flowers, typically found in the mystical groves of the Eldeen Reaches, have adapted to the urban environment of Sharn.

In the political landscape, this event has been largely met with passive interest. Some members of the [[Aurum]] have taken to decorating their estates with these glowing blossoms, viewing them as a status symbol. Meanwhile, [[House Vadalis]], bearers of the Mark of Handling and known for their expertise in flora and fauna, have expressed a desire to study these flowers further.

While the Starlight Blossoms' arrival is a minor event in the grand scheme of Sharn's bustling life, it serves as a gentle reminder of the world's enduring magic and mystery. As the city continues its daily hustle and bustle, the Starlight Blossoms glow quietly, adding a touch of serene beauty to the City of Towers.
