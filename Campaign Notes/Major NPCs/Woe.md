### Concept

Woe is a decommissioned warforged soldier who served with distinction in the Last War. After the Treaty of Thronehold left him without purpose, he willingly underwent a profane ritual by Mordakesh to replace his heart with a Khyber dragonshard fragment, granting him sinister powers as a [[Woe#Abilities & Powers|Warlock Lich]].  

### Description 

- Appearance: A bulky, 7 ft tall warforged with numerous battle scars. His eyes glow an ominous purple. The hollow cavity in his chest flickers with a faint violet light.     ![[Woe portrait.png|right|230]]

- Personality: Driven by a sense of purpose and duty, but his methods are merciless. Has disdain for the "weakness" of living creatures.  

- Mannerisms: Speaks in a commanding, metallic voice, with a prose that is strong but short and to-rhe-point. Carries out orders swiftly and efficiently. Never wastes movements in combat.

### Backstory

Woe was an elite warforged soldier constructed centuries ago by House Cannith. He was unwaveringly loyal and skilled in warfare. One day in the midst of battle, Woe was struck down and killed by a halfling known as *Dandal*.

Dandal had been carrying a "lucky" family heirloom - a small fragment of a larger [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] - which attached a dark cancer upon Woe's soul as he died. 

Woe awoke, months later, in the laboratories of [[Mordakhesh]], having been revi

Mordakesh promised him a new reason for being - serving the overlord Rak Tulkesh. Woe agreed to undergo a profane ritual that fused a Khyber dragonshard fragment containing a sliver of the overlord's essence into his metallic body, awakening sinister powers.

### Motivations

- Regain the sense of purpose he felt during the Last War
- Give all warforged the new purpose he has now found, serving a greater power.
- Hunt down fractured Khyber dragonshards to increase his power

### Foreboding Premonitions
**Disturbed Dreams:** Players experience vivid nightmares where they're battling an overwhelming purple darkness, or Woe himself, only to wake up with a sense of dread. These dreams could occasionally provide cryptic clues or warnings about Woe's plans, wrapped in metaphorical imagery related to Woe's backstory or abilities.

**Purple Lightning:** Before a significant encounter or event linked to Woe, the sky could be lit by rare and unnatural purple lightning, even without a storm. This phenomenon, witnessed by the players or recounted by locals, serves as an omen of Woe's direct involvement or the presence of his power.

**Reflections in Water:** On occasion, when the players look into still water, their reflections could momentarily shift to show them as lifeless, puppet-like versions of themselves, with glowing purple eyes. This unsettling vision fades quickly but leaves an eerie feeling of being marked by Woe.

### Abilities & Powers

- Granted Warlock-like abilities from his patron [[Rak Tulkesh]].
- His phylactery is the [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber shard]] resting in the center of his chest.
- The shard contains both a small sliver of Rak Tulkesh's power and part of Woe's soul.
- The dragonshard is indestructible, due to the power contained within.
	- If Woe is killed, his soul will remain in the shard until it can take over the body of another creature
	- As Woe gathers more [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] fragments, Rak Tulkesh's influence over Woe will grow until he is completely under the Overlord's control.

### Connections & Hooks

- Attacked the PCs' airship to capture a dragonshard fragment!
- Carries out violent raids to obtain shards scattered across Khorvaire.
