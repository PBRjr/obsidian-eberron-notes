Warehouse full of poor workers creating dreamlily for the Boromar clan
- run by Halak Boromar's side, not Castar
- Enforcers all left moments before party arrived, after they were informed of an incoming raid by the Red Cloak Battalion

## Plot
- turned over furniture, left behind belongings, general signs of leaving in a hurry.
- Note on desk in back: *"We have a mole. Red Cloak Battalion raid today. Kill the Filth, burn the house with Sharn's finest in it. Meet at O's Whip. Take the prisoner with you."*
- [[Godlings, Demigods, and Other Mythical Creatures]] is on the desk from his capture
- flashing crystal wrapped with a magical conduit on desk next to note. Wires lead to various structures in the warehouse
	- Bomb timer: bomb flashes faster and increases in pitch as it gets closer to detonating.
	- Top of round 4: Skill challenge to escape the collapsed warehouse & Red cloak Battalion.

## Roster
Warehouse is empty of live personnel. Corpses of drug slaves (Filth) littered throughout warehouse, executed.
- Hobgoblin death captain leader ([[Statblocks#Hobgoblin Death Captain|Kazrak the Unyielding]]) of the Red Cloak Battalion
	- [[Garhorn & Blinker]] knows of him - never accepts bribes, dangerous
Extra [[Statblocks#Orc Blitzer|guards]] help during the raid
