[[Vorak, the Rageblight]]

## Arena Brainstorming
This shift in theme adds a lot of tragic weight to the fight. Instead of a dwarven fortress, this is a **defiled holy site**. You are fighting a monster of pure hate in a place dedicated to a "god" (Varyn) who believes he is a failure, built by a Clan (Flameforge) that has been forgotten.

Here is the revised battle map concept: **The Sanctum of the Broken Wing**.

### **Visual Theme**
An open-air courtyard at the mountain's peak. The architecture is **Ancient Human/Couatl Syncretic**—elegant white marble and grey stone, smoothed by wind, circular and flowing rather than blocky and rigid.
*   **Lighting:** The grey storm light contrasts with the **Red Rageblight mist** clinging to the ground and the **Gold/Silver glow** of the Legacy Stone.
*   **The Snow:** The courtyard is buried. Drifts are piled high against broken columns, creating a landscape of white hills and jagged ruins.

### **Map Layout (Dimensions: ~35x45 squares)**

#### **1. Zone A: The Oculus (The Objective)**
*   **Location:** Exact Center.
*   **Terrain:** A circular mosaic floor (20ft diameter), miraculously cleared of snow by the swirling winds of the summit. The mosaic depicts a feathered serpent (Siberys) coiling around a dark crystal (Khyber)—the "Triad of Soul" concept Geralt’s parents studied.
*   **Feature:** **The Legacy Stone** is placed dead center, on the "eye" of the mosaic.
*   **Mechanic:** This is **Normal Terrain**. It is the only safe footing.
*   **Vorak’s Tactic:** Vorak knows this is the "kill zone." He will try to grapple players and drag them *out* of this circle into the deep snow.

#### **2. Zone B: The Ribs of Siberys (Verticality/Cover)**
*   **Location:** Surrounding the Oculus are 6 massive, curved stone arches. They look like the ribcage of a great beast, or the framing of a roof that has long since rotted away.
*   **Height:** 15ft – 20ft high.
*   **Mechanic:**
    *   **For Players:** These provide **Half Cover** from Vorak’s *Hurl Debris*.
    *   **For Vorak:** He uses his **Climb Speed** to skitter up these arches. He perches on top of them like a gargoyle, looking down at the party before using *Barbarous Leap* to crash down on someone in the Oculus.

#### **3. Zone C: The Drift (The Hazard)**
*   **Location:** Everything outside the Oculus.
*   **Terrain:** Waist-deep snow mixed with crumbled masonry.
*   **Mechanic:** **Difficult Terrain.**
*   **Rageblight Synergy:** The **Red Mist** (Lair Action) lingers in the depressions of the snow here, making it hard to see *where* the damaging zones are until you step into them.

#### **4. Zone D: The Four Vows (The Sigil Anchors)**
*   **Location:** The four corners of the courtyard (N, S, E, W).
*   **Terrain:** These are four distinct shrines that Clan Flameforge built to honor the virtues Varyn was *supposed* to embody (but failed).
    *   **North (The Vow of Loyalty):** A statue of a human warrior offering a sword. (Provide Cover).
    *   **South (The Vow of  Sacrifice):** A frozen fountain/basin. (Difficult Terrain/Ice).
    *   **East (The Vow of Legacy):** An ancient, frozen block of ice. (Elevation 5ft).
    *   **West (The Vow of Power):** A tall, singular obelisk pointing to the sky. (Blocks Line of Sight).
*   **Phase 2 Logic:** The chains from the Legacy Stone will lash out and wrap around these four monuments. To weaken Vorak, the players effectively have to **destroy the last remnants of Clan Flameforge’s history.**

### **Dynamic Map Progression**

#### **Phase 1: The Shadow in the Ruins**
*   **The Atmosphere:** The blizzard is blinding. Players can barely see the **Four Vows** on the perimeter.
*   **Vorak's Movement:**
    *   He utilizes the **Ribs of Siberys** (Arches) to stay above the snow.
    *   He leaps from Arch to Arch, forcing players to look up.
    *   *Hurl Debris:* He rips loose stones from the arches, raining masonry down on Geralt while he tries to tune the Stone.

#### **Phase 2: The Tether (The desecration)**
*   **The Trigger:** The Legacy Stone flares. Chains shoot out to the **Four Vows**.
*   **The Visual:** The chains glow with Syberis light, but they are pulling against Vorak's Khyber corruption. The tension causes the **Four Vows** to crack.
*   **The Tactics:**
    *   Players must wade through the **Zone C (Deep Snow)** to reach the shrines.
    *   Vorak anchors himself at the **Oculus**. When a player breaks a Sigil (e.g., smashes the Statue of Courage), Vorak uses his reaction to *Release Fury* or charge them.
    *   *Narrative Beat:* As they destroy the Sigils, they are destroying the shrines Varyn is trying to protect in his memory. This parallels the destruction of the Clan.

#### **Phase 3: The Collapse (The Cage)**
*   **The Event:** When the final Sigil breaks, the magical backlash blows the **Ribs of Siberys** outward.
*   **Map Change:**
    *   The Arches collapse, creating a wall of impassable rubble around the center.
    *   The outer ring (The Vows) falls away down the mountain or becomes covered in an avalanche.
    *   **Arena Size:** The map shrinks to just the **Oculus (20ft)** and a tight ring of debris.
*   **The Fight:** Vorak engages *Reckless Engine*. There is no cover. No running. Just the party and the machine-beast on the mosaic of the Serpent and the Dragonshard.

### **Specific Vorak Interactions with this Map**

1.  **Barbarous Leap:**
    *   *Scenario:* Vorak is atop a 15ft Arch. He leaps down *over* the tank's head to land on Geralt in the center.
2.  **Pushing Attack (Unleash Fury):**
    *   *Scenario:* Vorak stands in the **Oculus**. He releases the pulse. Players are pushed 10ft back.
    *   *Consequence:* They are pushed off the clean floor into the **Deep Snow**. They are now prone in difficult terrain. Getting up costs half movement, and moving back to the center costs double. They are effectively pinned down.
3.  **Rage Pockets (Mist):**
    *   *Scenario:* Vorak spawns the mist *on top* of the **Ribs of Siberys**.
    *   *Tactic:* This forces the Ranger/Casters off the high ground, making them trudge through the snow where Vorak can catch them.

### **Narrative Descriptions for the DM**

*   **The Vows:** "Through the swirling snow, you see the frozen statue of a kneeling knight—The Vow of Sacrifice. It remains untouched by time, a memory of the Clan's glory, until Vorak's corruption lashes a chain around it, cracking the stone neck."
*   **The Legacy Stone:** "The Stone sits upon the mosaic eye of the Couatl. As Geralt works the device, the gold light illuminates the snow, casting long, dancing shadows of the rib-like arches around you."
*   **Phase 3 Transition:** "The mountain groans. The arches that held the sky above this shrine for centuries give way. Tons of marble and ice crash down, sealing you in. The wind stops. The silence is heavy, broken only by the mechanical whirring of Vorak's heart."


## Fight Mechanics
Within a rageblight zone, Geralt must use an action on the Legacy Stone multiple times and succeed to rip the essence of Khyber out of Vorak's soul and bind it to the Legacy Stone.

**Legacy Stone Stats:** AC 18, 50 HP, immune to all damage except necrotic

#### Phase 1: The Assassin (100% HP to 0 HP / First Health Bar)

_Vorak is calculating. He wants to destroy the Legacy Stone because he knows it is his weakness._

- **Objective:** The players must channel into the stone (Action) to activate it while keeping Vorak away from it. They must then strike at him while he is vulnerable.
- **Vorak's Behavior:** He uses _Assassin's Reflexes_ to Disengage from the "Tank" characters and rush the "Squishy" characters or the Stone. He prioritizes destroying the Stone (AC 18, HP 50).
- **Mechanic:** He has resistance to all damage in this phase _unless_ a player successfully uses an Action on the Legacy Stone to "Illuminate" him for one round.

**Legacy Stone Action**
* Using an action on the legacy stone and succeeding a DC 15 Charisma saving throw will *Illuminate* Vorak, giving advantage to all attacks made against him and removing all vulnerabilities for one round.

#### Phase 2: The Tether (Transition)

_When Vorak is reduced to 0 HP the first time, or the Legacy Stone is fully charged after 3 rounds:_

- **Narrative:** The Legacy Stone fires a beam of light, locking onto Vorak. He screams, regenerating 100 HP (Mythic Trait activates).
- **Key Mechanic:** **The Sigils.** 4 Ethereal Chains connect Vorak to the Stone. Large glowing runes (Sigils) appear in the air.
- **Vorak's Buff:** Vorak is **Immune to all damage** while the chains exist.
- **Player Goal:** Destroy the Sigils (AC 15, 20 HP each, HP threshhold 10).
- **Villain Action:** Every time a Sigil breaks, Vorak uses a Reaction to make a full movement and a single Greatsword attack against the person who broke it.


#### Phase 3: Shattered Identity (The Final Burn)

_When all Sigils are broken:_

- **Narrative:** A mechanical heart suddenly protrudes out his chest, a purple glow within fading fast. The look on the creatures face tells you that the calculating Assassin is gone; only the beast remains.

- **Vorak's Debuff:**
    - He loses all Damage Resistances.
    - He becomes **Vulnerable to Psychic Damage**.
    - He instantly loses the ability to Disengage or Hide.
- **Vorak's Buff (Rageblight Aura):** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of Vorak takes 10 Necrotic damage.
- **Behavior:** He stops being tactical. He attacks the closest target repeatedly using _Reckless Engine_ every single turn.
