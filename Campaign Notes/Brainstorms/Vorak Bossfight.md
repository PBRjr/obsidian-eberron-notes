The party must find a 'rageblight zone' in the aftermath of Vorak's rampage.

Geralt must focus on the Legacy Stone, or any other capable Siberys dragonshard, which summon and bind Vorak to their location

This leads to a primary objective during the fight other than simply beating Vorak into submission. The legacy stone causes Vorak to...
1. fight in different stages that must be defeated differently?
2. Release collections of power that must be destroyed to weaken Vorak?
3. Some other boss fight mechanic?

After this is achieved, Vorak will be left unable to fight back, his mind cleaned of its dark blight, however his life soon to be over.
