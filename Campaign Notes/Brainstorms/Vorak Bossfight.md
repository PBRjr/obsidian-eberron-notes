[[Vorak, the Rageblight]]

Within a rageblight zone, Geralt must use an action on the Legacy Stone multiple times and succeed to rip the essence of Khyber out of Vorak's soul and bind it to the Legacy Stone.

**Legacy Stone Stats:** AC 18, 50 HP, immune to all damage except necrotic

This leads to a primary objective during the fight other than simply beating Vorak into submission. The legacy stone causes Vorak to...
1. fight in different stages that must be defeated differently?
2. Release collections of power that must be destroyed to weaken Vorak?
3. Some other boss fight mechanic?

After this is achieved, Vorak will be left unable to fight back, his mind cleaned of its dark blight, however his life soon to be over.

#### Phase 1: The Assassin (100% HP to 0 HP / First Health Bar)

_Vorak is calculating. He wants to destroy the Legacy Stone because he knows it is his weakness._

- **Objective:** The players must channel into the stone (Action) to charge it while keeping Vorak away from it.
- **Vorak's Behavior:** He uses _Assassin's Reflexes_ to Disengage from the "Tank" characters and rush the "Squishy" characters or the Stone. He prioritizes destroying the Stone (AC 18, HP 50).
- **Mechanic:** He has resistance to all damage in this phase _unless_ a player successfully uses an Action on the Legacy Stone to "Illuminate" him for one round.

**Legacy Stone Action**
* Using an action on the legacy stone and succeeding a DC 15 Charisma saving throw will *Illuminate* Vorak, making him vulnerable to all damage and halving his speed.

#### Phase 2: The Tether (Transition)

_When Vorak is reduced to 0 HP the first time, or the Legacy Stone is fully charged after 3 rounds:_

- **Narrative:** The Legacy Stone fires a beam of light, locking onto Vorak. He screams, regenerating 100 HP (Mythic Trait activates).
- **Key Mechanic:** **The Sigils.** 4 Ethereal Chains connect Vorak to the Stone. Large glowing runes (Sigils) appear in the air.
- **Vorak's Buff:** Vorak is **Immune to all damage** while the chains exist.
- **Player Goal:** Destroy the Sigils (AC 15, 20 HP each).
- **Villain Action:** Every time a Sigil breaks, Vorak uses a Reaction to make a full movement and a single Greatsword attack against the person who broke it.


#### Phase 3: Shattered Identity (The Final Burn)

_When all Sigils are broken:_

- **Narrative:** A mechanical heart suddenly protrudes out his chest, a purple glow within fading fast. The look on the creatures face tells you that the calculating Assassin is gone; only the beast remains.

- **Vorak's Debuff:**
    - He loses all Damage Resistances.
    - He becomes **Vulnerable to Psychic Damage**.
    - He instantly loses the ability to Disengage or Hide.
- **Vorak's Buff (Rageblight Aura):** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of Vorak takes 10 Necrotic damage.
- **Behavior:** He stops being tactical. He attacks the closest target repeatedly using _Reckless Engine_ every single turn.
