The party must find a 'rageblight zone' in the aftermath of Vorak's rampage.

Geralt must focus on the Legacy Stone, which will begin to hover 3 ft. off the ground and is unable to be moved until the ritual is complete. This will summon and bind Vorak to their location.

This leads to a primary objective during the fight other than simply beating Vorak into submission. The legacy stone causes Vorak to...
1. fight in different stages that must be defeated differently?
2. Release collections of power that must be destroyed to weaken Vorak?
3. Some other boss fight mechanic?

After this is achieved, Vorak will be left unable to fight back, his mind cleaned of its dark blight, however his life soon to be over.

### Phase 1: The Binding (HP 100% to 70%)

**Key Mechanic**: Vorak is tethered to the Legacy Stone with energy threads. He can not leave the rageblight zone.

- During this phase, Vorak will try to break free of the binding.
- Players must protect the Legacy Stone while fighting Vorak.
- Environmental effect: Pockets of concentrated rage appear as swirling red mist that damage players:
	- 3d6 psychic damage
	- 10ft radius
	- 1 will spawn within 15 feet of each PC. At the start of each round, a pocket will move to the location that it's PC was in at the start of their last turn.

**Special Actions**:

- **Sever Binding**: Vorak targets the Legacy Stone directly (AC 18, 50 HP, resistant to all damage except necrotic). If destroyed, the fight becomes much harder.
- **Rage Siphon**: Vorak absorbs nearby rage energy, healing himself for 2d10 HP.
- **Unleash Fury**: AOE attack dealing 4d8 damage to all creatures within 15 feet, or half on dex save, knocking them back 10 ft and prone upon a fail.

**Transition**: When Vorak reaches 70% HP, he lets out a horrific scream and shatters the ground around him.

### Phase 2: Fractured Sigils (70% - 40%)
**Key Mechanic:**
- The tethering lines morph and shift, turning into radiantly glowing sigils that float in fixed positions on the battlefield. Destroying one sigil removed 5% of Vorak's HP. Vorak is immune to direct damage while at least 1 sigil remains. He has advantage to all saving throws while at least 3 sigils remains.
