_Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement)_

> _The grand weapon of the Knight of the North. Its blade burns with a cold, platinum fire that repels the creeping mists._

**Sentience:** The sword vaguely senses the direction of its purpose. It pulses with warmth when facing the source of the corruption it is meant to destroy.

#### Current State (The Lantern)
- **Magic Weapon:** You have a **+1 bonus** to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

- **Platinum Kindling:** When unsheathed, the blade sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. While the blade is lit, it deals an extra **2d4 radiant damage** on a hit. The blade can be lit and extinguished with a bonus action.

- **Mist Walker:** The light emitted by this weapon cuts through the thickest obscuration. It treats magical darkness as dim light. Additionally, it automatically disperses non-magical fog and the **Dead-Grey Mists** of the Mournland within its bright light radius, creating a safe bubble for travel.

#### Awakened State (The Climax)
- **Magic Weapon:** The bonus increases to **+2**.
- **Roaring Seraph:** The platinum fire intensifies. The extra damage increases to **2d8 radiant damage**.
- **Absolute Clarity:** The light now fully dispels magical darkness within 30 feet.
- **Aura of the North:** You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects
