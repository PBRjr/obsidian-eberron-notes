Bjorn, my son,

It took me too long to find a way to get this letter to you, and I curse the necessity of placing it in the hands of House Sivis. I despise dealing with coin-clutchers and contract-lickers, but I had no other choice. The winds that once whispered omens to me now howl with silence, and I find myself looking into shadows where once there was light.

Hrothgar grows stronger. The dark plight upon his soul has become a weight upon our people, pressing them into submission, into something lesser than what they once were. There was a time when our kin followed you out of loyalty, believing in your strength. Now, they've been corrupted, made to kneel under his influence.

I have tried to see what is to come, to divine the path ahead. But Hrothgar is a void in my sight. He always was, even when he was a boy, his future was never clear to me. I remember one vision, long ago—one that still lingers in my mind like the scent of blood in the snow. I saw him, standing over a cliff side, a divine weapon resting at his feet, a small purple crystal dangling from a necklace in the palm of his hand. The body of a man clad in bloody steel tumbled to the rocks below. That was the farthest I ever glimpsed into his fate. Beyond that, there was nothing. I did not understand the meaning of it then, and now, as I watch the man he has become, I wonder if that moment was always meant to be a turning point.

A year and a half ago, a man came to our camp. He did not leave. Though it pains me to write this, I wonder if it should have been Hrothgar thrown fruom that cliff instead.

I fear what is coming, my dear Bearwolf. Not because I know what is ahead, but because for the first time in my life, I do not. Even when I foresaw Kvitrafn’s death, there was sorrow, but there was also a certainty in it. I could prepare. I could grieve before the loss came. But now, I stand in the dark, blind to what lies ahead. And that terrifies me.

Do not mistake my words for a plea, my son. You are your own man, walking your own path. But if the winds carry you back to these lands, know that the world you left behind is not the one you will find.

Your Mother
