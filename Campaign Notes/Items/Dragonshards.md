# Dragonshards: A Typological Analysis

_Excerpt from "Fundamental Eberronian Materials: Classifications and Applications" by Loremaster Thelen d'Sivis_

The three varieties of dragonshards represent perhaps the most significant magical resources on our continent, if not our entire world. Each type corresponds to one of the Progenitor Dragons and possesses distinct properties that make them invaluable for different magical applications.

## Eberron Dragonshards

Eberron dragonshards, colloquially known as "dragon's blood," are the most common variety found throughout Khorvaire. These translucent crystals contain distinctive veins of crimson that pulse with internal radiance when properly activated. They typically form in shallow soil, riverbeds, and similar terrestrial locations.

Their primary application lies in elemental bindingâ€”the process that powers our lightning rails, airships, and elemental galleons. The unique resonance pattern of these shards allows them to form a containment matrix suitable for housing bound elementals without disrupting their essential nature.

## Siberys Dragonshards

The rarest and most coveted variety, Siberys shards or "dragon's tears," fall from the Ring of Siberys that encircles our world. These golden crystals possess an internal luminescence that appears almost solar in quality. Unlike their earthbound cousins, they must be gathered where they fall, as they cannot be mined or cultivated.

The relationship between Siberys shards and dragonmarks cannot be overstated. These fragments enhance dragonmark powers and serve as the foundation for focus items used by marked houses. Their rarity and potency make them especially valuable to the dragonmarked houses, who will pay extraordinary sums for particularly pure specimens.

## Khyber Dragonshards

Often referred to as "dragon's teeth," Khyber shards form deep within the world in caverns, fissures, and the darker recesses of Khyber itself. These obsidian-like crystals contain swirling patterns that appear almost like trapped smoke, typically in shades of deep purple or midnight blue.

These shards possess a natural affinity for binding extraplanar entities and manipulating the boundaries between planes. For those who wish to pay a heftier price, they may also be used to bind elementals that can power vehicles, similar to Eberron shards. Demonologists and summoners prize them for creating binding circles and receptacles for captured fiends. They also serve as essential components in the creation of certain cursed items and artifacts associated with the darker aspects of magic. Their unpredictable magical properties make them particularly valuable for experimental artifice, though their use is often viewed with suspicion by mainstream magical institutions.
