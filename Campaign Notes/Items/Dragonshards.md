Dragonshards are fragments of the bodies of the progenitor dragons, and each type is associated with one of the dragons. These mystical stones have the ability to hold and channel magical energy, making them an integral part of many magical items and spells. They come in three types: Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron shards, each with unique characteristics and applications.

**Eberron Dragonshards**
Eberron shards, also known as "dragon's blood" (not to be confused with [[Dragon Blood]]) or bloodstones, are the most common type. They are typically found in rock formations or riverbeds across the world of Eberron. This shard's radiant, multicolored veins stand in stark contrast to its otherwise transparent exterior. Eberron shards are used to bind elemental creatures and power the mighty airships and lightning rails. They also play a vital role in the creation and operation of the Warforged and sentient constructs. ^90b643

**Siberys Dragonshards**
Siberys shards, or "dragon's tears", are the rarest and most coveted of the three. They are not found in the ground but instead fall from the Ring of Siberys that encircles the world. These shards are golden and exhibit a radiant glow. They are predominantly used for the creation of dragonmarks and serve as key components in the highest echelons of artifice. The Siberys shards are coveted by those with dragonmarks, as they can augment and enhance their powers. ^b906e5

**Khyber Dragonshards**
Khyber shards, known as "dragon's teeth", are found deep within the world, in the underdark and other subterranean locales. These shards have a sinister, dark hue, often perceived as an abyssal black or a deep blue. Khyber shards are used to create binding circles and magic items that contain or utilize fiends or other extraplanar entities. Their energy is considered potent but unpredictable, which often leads to their use in more nefarious magical applications. ^023b44
