-  warforged were made using the souls of fallen soldiers during the last war.
- Their creation involved trapping the soul in some kind of metal heart.
	- It looks like a small sphere with runes engraved on it, which subtly glowed with a golden-violet hue.
 - Forge was created in the first batch of modern warforged - and the only one that didn't lose his mind due to his new found form. All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.
 - All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead soldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.
 - In a battle during the last war, he sacrificed his and his men's lives in an explosion he set off to overtake the enemy.
 - Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and infused into a warforged body. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.
He has a note ripped out of an artificer's journal he found prior to destroying his creation forge.
He was at The Lighthouse because he knew it contained a portal to Sharn.

### Artificer Journal Page Handout

---
The latest series of experiments aimed at recreating The Prototype has once again ended in failure. The primary challenge continues to be the integration of both Khyber and Siberys dragonshards into a single cohesive device.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Energetic Incompatibility:** When attempting to merge Khyber and Siberys dragonshards, the inherent properties of each shard result in violent energetic reactions. The Khyber shard's chaotic dark energy and the Siberys shard's radiant light energy create a destabilizing feedback loop, leading to catastrophic device failure.

3. **Material Fracture:** Even with the most refined binding agents and stabilization matrices, the structural integrity of the device cannot withstand the opposing forces of the shards. Repeated trials show that the casing fractures under the pressure, often shattering both the dragonshards and the housing materials.

3. **Arcane Conductivity Issues:** The arcane circuits designed to channel the combined energies of both shards are proving inadequate. The conduits either overload or burn out, unable to handle the simultaneous flow of both types of energy. This results in significant power loss and unpredictable surges.

**Current Adjustments & Theories:**
- **Single Shard Usage:** Given the repeated failures with dual-shard integration, we have temporarily shifted our focus to single shard implementations. Utilizing only a Khyber or Siberys shard simplifies the energy matrix, but this solution is incomplete and leads to noted psychosis in test subjects. The posthumous cooperation of fallen soldiers provides critical insights, yet their spirits are less stable under these conditions. Stabilization methods are in testing phase and are proving effective. 

- **Arcane Filtration:** We are exploring the potential of using arcane filters or buffers to mediate the energies of the two shards. The idea is to create a phased energy conduit that can sequentially manage the influx and outflux of each shard's energy rather than attempting simultaneous integration.
