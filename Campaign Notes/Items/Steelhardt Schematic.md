Figure 7.1: Steelhardt Transference Core Assembly - Partial Deconstruction

The illustration showcases a partially deconstructed view of the Steelhardt's Transference Core Assembly, highlighting the intricate balance between arcane engineering and ethereal dynamics. Each component is carefully labeled, with detailed notations on function, material composition, and magical imbue.

1. Transference Core Housing:
    - Material: Arcanite Alloy; a blend of mithral and adamantine, tempered with dragon's blood.
    - Function: Provides an indestructible container for the Transference Core, ensuring no external magical or physical forces can disrupt the soul's containment.
    - Notation: Forged under a full moon, cooled in the waters of a Thelanis spring to enhance magical conductivity.

1. Runes of Binding (Detail A):
    - Inscription Technique: Laser precision etching with a phoenix feather quill, imbued with essence of a previously used and now unoccupied lich phylactery.
    - Function: Anchors the soul within the Transference Core, preventing drift or dissolution during and after transfer.

2. Arcane Conduits (Detail B):
    - Material: Veins of pure leyline quartz, wrapped in silver and gold filigree.
    - Function: Channels ambient magical energy to maintain the Core's operational integrity, ensuring a constant energy flow.
    - Notation: Conduits are aligned according to the planar geometry, optimizing the draw of arcane power.

1. Soul Resonance Chamber:
    - Structure: A spherical chamber surrounding the Core, layered with echo crystal and moonstone.
    - Function: Amplifies the soul's vibrational energy, ensuring compatibility with the mechanical body and enhancing control fidelity.

2. Transference Shard (Detail C):
    - Material: A perfectly intact Siberys Dragonshard, no smaller than 0.77 Aundair Shard Standard but no larger than 0.86 ASS.
    - Function: Container for the willing conscious soul, maintains spiritual alignment.
    - Notation: Elemental balance is crucial; misalignment may result in erratic behavior or loss of control.
3. Feedback Loop Stabilizer:
    - Mechanism: A dual-layered coil of electrum and orichalcum, interwoven with strands of unicorn mane.
    - Function: Regulates the flow of magical energy within the device, preventing overload or burnout during the transference process.
    - Notation: The stabilizer is tuned to the soul's unique frequency, ensuring a seamless integration without loss of essence.
4. Ethical Safeguard Latch (Detail D):
    - Mechanism: A small, but complex lock mechanism, accessible only through a key made of pure conscience crystal.
    - Function: Ensures the device can only be activated with informed consent from the soul being transferred.
    - Notation: The key is metaphysical, formed from the collective agreement of all parties involved, manifesting as a tangible object.

Closing Remarks: This page of the schematic serves as a crucial reference for the assembly and understanding of the Steelhardt's core components. It highlights the Wolfsbanes' commitment to precision, balance, and ethical considerations in their groundbreaking work. Builders and operators of the Steelhardt must possess not only a deep understanding of arcane mechanics but also a profound respect for the soul and life itself.
