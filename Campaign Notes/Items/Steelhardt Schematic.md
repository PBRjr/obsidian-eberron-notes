Transference Core Housing:
    - Material: Arcanite Alloy; a blend of mithral and adamantine, tempered with dragon's blood.
    - Function: Provides an indestructible container for the Transference Core, ensuring no external magical or physical forces can disrupt the soul's containment.
    - Notation: Forged under a full moon, cooled in the waters of a Thelanis spring to enhance magical conductivity.

 Runes of Binding:
    - Inscription Technique: Laser precision etching with a phoenix feather quill, imbued with essence of a previously used and now unoccupied lich phylactery.
    - Function: Anchors the soul within the Transference Core, preventing drift or dissolution during and after transfer.

 Arcane Conduits:
    - Material: Veins of pure leyline quartz, wrapped in silver and gold filigree.
    - Function: Channels ambient magical energy to maintain the Core's operational integrity, ensuring a constant energy flow.
    - Notation: Conduits are aligned according to the planar geometry, optimizing the draw of arcane power.

Soul Resonance Chamber:
    - Structure: A spherical chamber surrounding the Core, layered with echo crystal and moonstone.
    - Function: Amplifies the soul's vibrational energy, ensuring compatibility with the mechanical body and enhancing control fidelity.

Transference Shard:
    - Material: A perfectly intact Siberys Dragonshard, no smaller than 0.77 Aundair Shard Standard but no larger than 0.86 ASS.
    - Function: Container for the willing conscious soul, maintains spiritual alignment.
    - Notation: Elemental balance is crucial; misalignment may result in fragmentation of soul and/or complete or partial uninstallation of persona.

Feedback Loop Stabilizer:
    - Mechanism: A dual-layered coil of electrum and orichalcum, interwoven with strands of unicorn mane.
    - Function: Regulates the flow of magical energy within the device, preventing overload or burnout during the transference process.

Ethical Safeguard Latch:
    - Mechanism: A small, but complex lock mechanism, accessible only through a key made of pure conscience crystal.
