#### Followers of Siberys and the Couatl

>Throughout history, numerous groups have devoted themselves to the worship of Siberys, the great dragon above, and the revered Couatl. These followers, including the Knights of the Silver Sky and the Order of the Eternal Dawn, have risen and fallen with time, each leaving a mark upon Eberron's history.
>
>Yet, none but one of these groups have endured since the legendary sacrifice of the Couatl. This one enduring group is believed to live secluded in the Byeshk Mountains, though this remains largely rumor, with no definitive evidence of their existence. Their name and true nature are lost to history, shrouded in mystery and legend.
