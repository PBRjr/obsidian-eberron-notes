### Description

- A shattered [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber Dragonshard]] the size of a fist, covered in ancient draconic runes with a faint glow pulsing from within
- The gem is warm to the touch and has a gentle pulsing vibration.
- It has 4 visible chunks taken out of it, which clearly bore additional runes that are now missing.

### History

- As a part of the ancient ritual involving the sacrifice of the Couatl, Rak Tulkesh's avatar was separated from his demi planes, exposing a vulnerability. 
- Beaten by a force of ancient dragons, consciousness was sealed away in this Dragonshard.
- To keep it out of the hands of the [[Lords of Dust]], it was shattered, its fragments spread across the world.

### Powers/Abilities

- The Dragonshard contains the fragmented power of Rak Tulkesh.
- These shards are the sources of power [[Woe]] is seeking.
- They can be combined with a soul through a ritual, giving the user power, but also corrupting them.
- Once they are all combined again, the user's soul will be consumed as fuel to release Rak Tulkesh's avatar from its bonds.
- Can only be properly wielded by one that is *tainted*
	- 
### Location

- The main gem is [[Woe#Abilities & Powers|Woe's phylactery]]
	- Lick: 1 Shard before airship crash
	- [[Professor Baelen ir'Torn]]: 1 Shard
	- 2 remaining shards: unknown

### Interacting With It

- Touching a shard gives the wielder a sense of unimaginable power that has been splintered and broken, as if the vastness of it is unreachable, just beyond the horizon.
- The shard can not be destroyed while a part of Rak Tulkesh's power remains within. It can only be fractured and contained.

### Hook
- The Silver Flame is constantly searching for it, even ransacking the Players quarters if they find out about it.
- [[Woe]] seeks to increase his power using the shards
- [[Mordakesh]] seeks to consume Woe's soul with the completed Dragonshard and unleash his master.
