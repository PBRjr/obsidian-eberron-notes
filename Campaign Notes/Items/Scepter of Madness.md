+1 Quarterstaff

This weapon is a solid wooden quarterstaff with silver inlays on the haft and rings of solid silver at each end. A long flat blade is inlayed in the haft and can be extended out at a 90 degree angle with a small switch near the middle of the weapon as a free interaction.

When the blade is retracted, the Scepter of Madness deals 1d6 + STR + 1 bludgeoning damage. (silvered)

While the blade is extended, it deals 1d8 + STR + 1 slashing damage.

All attacks with the scepter count as magical.

Once per long rest, the user may cast [[crown-of-madness-xphb|Crown of Madness]].
