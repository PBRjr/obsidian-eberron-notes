### Description:

- This shimmering Siberys Dragonshard is 2 inches long with the diameter of a grape. It has a rapid, darting glow, as though something is bouncing off the inner walls of the shard, trying to find an exit.
- This dragonshard has been implanted with a part of Geralt's mother's consciousness, locked behind the memories she placed within. 
- Yelena and Norbit created this object in secret after seeing Merix d'Cannith's intentions with the [[Plot Web#Steelhardt (The Prototype)|Steelhardt]]. The Legacy Stone was intended as a way to communicate with [[Plot Web#PC Geralt Wolfsbane|Geralt]] about the dangers of their work should they die.
- Once all of the memories have been experienced by Geralt, part of Yelena's consciousness will be accessible, and she will be able to speak to Geralt through his mind. **She will only have the memories of her life up until she created the Legacy Stone.**

### Interacting With It:

- Once per long rest, when Geralt concentrates for at least 10 minutes while holding the Legacy Stone, he experiences a surge of warmth before his mind is flooded with a memory that is chosen at random from the table below.
- Geralt will continue to become 'ill' after every memory experienced due to his mother's consciousness trying to manifest within Geralt's mind. After the last memory, Geralt will become seriously ill. **He will have 1d4 days to heal until he is completely taken over by his mother.**
* The Shard, once cleansed of Yelena's essence through a ritual [[Plot Web#Varyn "The Valiant" Grayburn|Varyn]] knows of, can be used to capture and destroy other pure or impure essences. (Like that within [[Plot Web#Vorak|Vorak]])


***First Interaction***
>The Siberys dragonshard pulses warmly in your hand, its golden light seeping into your skin. For a moment, the *surroundings* around you fades, replaced by a rush of sensations, emotions, and fragmented images. It’s not your memory, you realize, but hers. You are seeing the world through your mother's eyes, feeling the world through her body.

***Memory Descriptions***
**Kismet's Prophecy:** 
> The world shimmers, your senses flooded with the sights and smells of a crowded marketplace. You feel a small hand clutching yours as you and Norbit stand before a half-elf woman with striking eyes. She traces lines on your palm, her touch strangely warm. An unsettling feeling of knowing, of seeing threads of destiny intertwining, washes over you. She doesn't speak, but images flash through your mind – a towering city, a shattered land, a powerful artifact, a snowy peak, a young boy facing a daunting task. A cold dread grips your heart.

**Norbit's Illness:**
> The air is heavy with the scent of parchment and ink. Lamplight flickers across a cluttered desk, illuminating diagrams and notes. You feel Norbit's hand trembling in yours as he coughs, a rattling sound that echoes in the silence. A wave of nausea washes over you, not from the illness, but from the crushing realization that time is slipping away. You glance at a drawing of a complex device, its intricate workings promising a solution, a chance to cheat fate.

**Sibernyan Discovery:**
>Wind howls outside, rattling the shutters of a small, isolated cabin perched atop a snow-covered mountain. Inside, a fire crackles in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on rough-hewn walls. You feel a mixture of anticipation and unease as you sit across a table from a figure shrouded in a thick cloak, his face obscured by the shadows. As he speaks, his voice is a low, melodic rumble, unlike any language you've ever heard. You sense an ancient wisdom, a connection to something beyond mortal comprehension. Norbit leans forward, his brow furrowed in concentration as he grasps the strange words, responding in kind.

**Steelhardt Prototype:** 
>The air vibrates with energy, tingling your skin. A faint humming sound fills the chamber as you and Norbit stand before a pulsing device. You feel a surge of triumph as you complete the final connection, the culmination of years of research. A brilliant light flares, momentarily blinding you, then fades, leaving behind a sense of awe and a lingering taste of ozone. A deep, primal fear whispers within you, a warning about the choices you've made, about the forces you've put into motion. You've done what no one else could, you've conquered a primal force of nature with nothing but your minds. You should be relieved. And yet, you can't shake the feeling that you just changed the course of the world in more ways than you can imagine. 

**House Cannith Escape:**
>Rain lashes your face, cold and relentless. Your heart pounds in your chest as you and Norbit race through the dark, winding alleys, a crying young boy clutched in your arms. You feel the presence of pursuers, their footsteps echoing on the cobblestones. You turn a corner, praying you lost them. Norbit squeezes your shoulder as you calm the boy whose head is nuzzling into your shirt. Terror grips you, fueled by the knowledge that you're not just protecting yourselves, but something far more precious, something that could change the world.

**The Rageblight**
> Three inch thick glass encased by cold steel is all that separates yourself and Norbit from... him. He's strapped to an exam table by concrete reinforced bindings that stress and crack as he strains against them. Dark red veins spider-web across his skin, which looks as though its been stretched across his body, as though any more tension would cause it to rip and tear in places. A large scar runs down the middle of his chest, inflamed and irritated. His eyes are jet black. "I don't know why this happened," you say aloud, "Our math checked out. The components were good. There's got to be something we're missing." Norbit starts a reply, but its interrupted with a cough from his lungs and a splatter of blood in his palm. Marix talks over him, his eyes fixed on the creature in the other room, "This is what happens if we get this wrong. He was one of my best before he volunteered. Now... I don't think there's anything left of him inside." The thing on the other side of the glass began to scream and strain against his bindings. The one holding his left arm splinters and shatters. He reaches over to start destroying his other bindings, but then a blue gas vents into the room, and he calms. "Now he's just a mistake... and an example. Don't get it wrong again."
### Location:

- Behind an impenetrable locked door in [[Wolfsbane Workshop]]

### Ownership/Affiliation: 

- House Cannith has been trying to get behind the locked door since Geralt's parents fled House Cannith.

### Significance: 

- Contained within are flashbacks to important memories in Yelena's life, from her perspective. They were planted in this stone by his parents for Geralt to find.
