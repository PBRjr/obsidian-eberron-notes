***Memory Descriptions***
**Kismet's Prophecy:** 
> The world shimmers, your senses flooded with the sights and smells of a crowded marketplace. You feel a small hand clutching yours as you and Norbit stand before a half-elf woman with striking eyes. She traces lines on your palm, her touch strangely warm. An unsettling feeling of knowing, of seeing threads of destiny intertwining, washes over you. She doesn't speak, but images flash through your mind â€“ a towering city, a shattered land, a powerful artifact, a young boy facing a daunting task. A cold dread grips your heart.


**Norbit's Illness:**
> The air is heavy with the scent of parchment and ink. Lamplight flickers across a cluttered desk, illuminating diagrams and notes. You feel Norbit's hand trembling in yours as he coughs, a rattling sound that echoes in the silence. A wave of nausea washes over you, not from the illness, but from the crushing realization that time is slipping away. You glance at a drawing of a complex device, its intricate workings promising a solution, a chance to cheat fate.
