Whether traveling over great distances or attempting to rest in a dangerous location, its important to know that a random encounter is always possible.

When in a situation that the DM thinks might provoke a random encounter, he will ask the party to each roll a d12. The DM will then roll his own d12 and compare it to those rolled by the party. If the DM's roll matches any one of the party members roll's, he then consults the appropriate random encounter table. 

In more high-risk situations, a lower dice than d12 may be used. The lower the dice, the higher the chance of a random encounter. 

Example: If the party is traveling over land by horse, the DM may request a series of d12 rolls for every x distance traveled. 

Example: If the party attempts to take a long rest in the middle of a dungeon, the DM may request a d4 or d6 random encounter roll.
