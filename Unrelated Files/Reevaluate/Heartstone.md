The Heartstone is a small, intriguing gem, partially transparent and of an entrancing orange hue. Its opaque core pulsates rhythmically with a deep, warm light, reminiscent of a heartbeat, hence its given name.

The Heartstone is not simply an artifact but a crystallized fragment of cosmic essence. The [[Progenitor Dragons]], the embodiments of [[Order]] and [[Dissonance]], created the world of [[Eberron]] from their own essence. [[Progenitor Dragons#Eberron|Eberron]], acting as the mediator between these primal forces, sacrificed a portion of its life force to manifest the Heartstone.

This pulsating gem serves as the fulcrum for the cosmic forces of Order and Dissonance. Encapsulated within its form, it balances these powers and mediates their influence on reality. Its existence ensures that neither Order nor Dissonance dominates the other, maintaining a delicate equilibrium that underpins the nature of the world.

Legends speak of the Heartstone as the true heart of Eberron, a beacon of balance and the key to the existence of life in all its forms. Its energy is said to have fueled the creation of the first races and continues to permeate every aspect of the world's reality.

Thus, while it appears small and delicate, the Heartstone is a potent and vital force, the essence of Eberron itself and the manifestation of the interplay between the primal forces of Order and Dissonance.

This delicate balance was disrupted when [[Syvander]], tricked by the false [[Draconic Prophecy]], released Dissonance. The Heartstone, in response, has since been working to restore the equilibrium, albeit slowly and with diminished strength due to the overwhelming chaos. Due to this increased strength of Dissonance, the Heartstone has begun to crack. If not reversed, it could break, shattering the fabric of reality.
