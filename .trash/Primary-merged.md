## Loro Cass

A broken and small middle aged halfling adult, Loro lost his daughter Monte several months ago when [[House Tarkanan]] attacked a [[The Tyrants|Tyrant]] safehouse with mourn weapons. Loro and his daughter were walking down a road when they were caught in the crossfire of such an attack. Barely escaping with his own life, Monte was struck by a beam of mysterious energy and disappeared, leaving no clue as to what exactly happened to her. 

His life now concerned with research into the organizations involved, Loro was lead to [[The Dragon's Breath Tavern]], where he overheard talk of something happening at the festival of [[Wildnight]]. This lead him to attend the festivities, keeping an eye out for anything suspicious. He happens to be in the area when the assassination takes place.

Witnessing the party deal with that situation may lead him to beg for their help in finding out what happened to his daughter.

## Marix d'Cannith


**Name**: Marix d'Cannith

**Race**: Human

Faction: Leader of [[Cannith South]]

**Class**: Artificer (Alchemist)

**Alignment**: Lawful Neutral

**Appearance**: Marix is a middle-aged man with greying hair and sharp, observant blue eyes. He carries the well-groomed look of a man of high standing, always dressed in the polished attire of [[House Cannith]]. His hands are calloused from years of detailed work.

---

**Personality**: Marix is driven and curious with a side of arrogance. He has a deep fascination with the Mourning's energies and firmly believes he can harness it for the betterment of House Cannith.

**Backstory**: Since the [[Day of Mourning]] nearly collapsed the once great House Cannith, the remains of nobility within struggle to rebuild. An intelligent alchemist and brilliant entrepreneur, Marix rose to the top of [[Cannith South]] by way of strategic business deals and new inventions. 

After discovering that a combination of rare metals and [[Dragonshards]] can harness the chaotic energies of the [[Mournland]], Marix started creating nearly uncontrollable and powerful weapons that he hopes will propel him to the top of the new unified House Cannith.

**Motivations**: Marix wants to elevate [[House Cannith]] and himself by mastering Mourning energy. However, his experiments have become increasingly dangerous as he struggles to control this unpredictable force. In order to test his new weaponry, he sells it to [[House Tarkanan]] with the expectation that they will secretly report back their findings.

---

**Roleplay Tips**: Play Marix as proud but increasingly desperate. He genuinely believes in his work's potential and is dismissive of any attempts to convince him of its dangers. As the campaign progresses and his control over the Mourning energy wanes, he might become more unstable and frantic.

Marix detests the leaders of his sister houses, and feels that he should be the one to unify Cannith and reestablish its place as the leader of the [[Dragonmarked Houses]].

---

**Relevant Information**: Marix is a stepping stone to the main plot. His experiments with Mourning energy are causing disruptions around Sharn, making him a target for investigation by the party.

**Connections**: 
Marix is supplying House Tarkanan with experimental weaponry fueled by Mourning energy.

~~Marix's actions indirectly lead to [[Aeren d'Cannith]]'s discovery of the coded documents about the [[Heartstone]], pushing the party towards uncovering the truth about the Day of Mourning.~~

## The Beggar King


The enigmatic figure known as the Beggar King rose from the impoverished streets of [[Sharn|Sharn's]] lower wards to become a major player within the [[Sharn underground]]. His true name and history are unknown - he is a disfigured, secretive individual whose body is covered in dozens of tiny, warped [[dragonmarks]] that grant him an eclectic array of magical abilities. This "mark madness", along with his fearsome street reputation, earned him the moniker "Beggar King."

The Beggar King runs an intelligence network of urchins, beggars and street thieves across Sharn called the [["Eyes of the King"]] that provides him invaluable insights into the city's workings. He is highly ambitious and sees House Tarkanan as a path to greater power and influence, ruthlessly manipulating both [[Thora Tarkanan]] and [[Marix d'Cannith]] for his own ends.

His relationship with Thora Tarkanan, the House's leader, is complex. She helped lift him from the depths of Sharn's slums and gave him his current position of prominence within the House. However, the Beggar King harbors greater ambitions to one day lead House Tarkanan himself, and Thora is well aware he may attempt to undermine or replace her. She tries to keep him placated on the ruling council while watching him closely for any signs of betrayal.

The Beggar King's deeper motivations stem from a tragic past. As a child he was the victim of horrific dragonmark experiments conducted by a member of [[House Cannith]] seeking to cultivate new marks. This left him both disfigured and traumatized. 

Fueled by rage, his lone objective is to tear once more tear the Tarkanan bloodline to the ground, and every aberrant dragonmark with it.

**Race**: Half-Elf

**Class/Level**: Rogue (Inquisitive) / Level 6

**Alignment**: Chaotic Good

**Appearance**: Aeren is a spry and wiry young man with a mix of elven and human features. He has short, ruffled hair, a pair of bright green eyes that always seem to be searching for something, and a half-smile that seldom leaves his face.

---

**Personality**: Aeren is naturally curious and has a knack for finding things out. He's friendly and charismatic, with a natural charm that can disarm even the gruffest individuals. But beneath the charm, he's a shrewd investigator who leaves no stone unturned.

**Backstory**: A lower-ranking member of [[House Cannith]], Aeren has always been more interested in uncovering the secrets of the past than in creating the future. This curiosity led him to start a side gig as an information broker, where his knack for piecing together bits of information has served him well, particularly by trading secrets in the [[Sharn underground]].

**Motivations**: Aeren is motivated by his curiosity and his love for solving mysteries. The discovery of the coded documents has piqued his interest, and he's determined to get to the bottom of things.

---

- As an Inquisitive Rogue, Aeren is good at reading people, spotting clues, and unraveling mysteries. He uses abilities like Insightful Fighting to take advantage of his keen eye for detail in combat.
- Aeren doesn't have any magical abilities, but he's quick with his wits and his rapier, making him a formidable opponent.

**Roleplay Tips**: Play Aeren as charismatic and inquisitive. He should be constantly probing, asking questions, and looking for hidden meanings in conversations. Despite his youthful charm, he's also cautious and careful, always keeping an eye out for potential dangers.

---

**Relevant Information**: Aeren's discovery of the coded documents are crucial plot points that lead the party on their quest to discover the truth about the [[Day of Mourning]].

**Factions**: Aeren is associated with [[House Cannith]], though his loyalty is more to himself than to any one faction or group.

**Connections**: Aeren's investigations bring him into conflict with Marix, who wants to keep his dangerous experiments a secret. This conflict serves as a stepping stone for the party to uncover the larger plot.

## Professor Baelen ir'Torn


A notably eccentric figure even within the diverse staff of [[Morgrave University]], Baelen ir'Torn stands out for his intense focus on esoteric magical phenomena. His vast knowledge and intense curiosity are only matched by his stubbornness and quick temper when challenged, traits which have garnered him both respect and dismissal among his colleagues.

Baelen's academic standing has been jeopardized by his unorthodox theories about the [[Day of Mourning]], which he ascribes to a cataclysmic disruption of primal forces. His propositions have been widely dismissed by his peers, and his credibility has suffered greatly as a result. Despite the widespread skepticism, Baelen has not been deterred from his beliefs.

Baelen's most significant possession is a seemingly [[Codex|blank book]] that he asserts is an old research journal of a figure that was directly involved in causing the Day of Mourning. It was left for him by an anonymous source one day. Unbenounced to him, this figure was [[Syvander]], whos actions are guided by the leading threads of the [[Prophecy]].

The journal's pages reveal their hidden contents when exposed to the energy of dragonshards. Baelen has deciphered a portion of the book using his collection of Eberron shards. However, to complete the decoding, he needs a [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber]] and a [[Dragonshards#^b906e5|Siberys]] shard. Lacking the adventuring skills to procure either, he has turned to the party for assistance.

His hope lies in validating his theories through the remaining content of the journal, clearing his name in academic circles, and more importantly, shedding more light on the calamitous Day of Mourning. Baelen ir'Torn may be eccentric, and his theories may seem outlandish, but his thirst for knowledge and understanding could lead to essential breakthroughs in comprehending the true nature of the Day of Mourning.

## Thora Tarkanan


Name: Thora Tarkanan
Race: Human
Faction: Leader of [[House Tarkanan]]
Class/Statblock: 
Alignment: Neutral Evil

---

**Appearance**: Thora is a striking figure with an erect posture that speaks to her authority. Her short hair is neatly braided, and she possesses captivating yellow eyes. A notable aberrant dragonmark graces her left forearm, marking her as a member of the infamous House Tarkanan.

**Mannerism**: One cannot help but notice Thora's distinct manner of speech. She enunciates each word with excessive clarity, which only adds to her commanding presence.

---

**Occupation/History**: Thora Tarkanan is the esteemed leader of House Tarkanan, carrying on the legacy of her great-great-grandfather, Lord [[Halas Tarkanan]]. She stands as a beacon of power and influence within her house.

**Abilities**: Despite lacking in physical strength or constitution, Thora more than makes up for it with her sharp intellect and charismatic personality. She possesses an uncanny ability to command attention and respect from those around her.

**Talent**: Thora is a linguist at heart. She has a talent for languages and is fluent in several tongues, making her an excellent communicator and negotiator.

---

**Motivations**: For Thora, leading House Tarkanan is her sole purpose. Seeing it return to its once ultimate power is her driving motivation, and everything else is secondary.

**Methods**: Years ago, Thora began receiving [[Anonymous Letters|letters]] from an anonymous source which unexplainably predicted certain events. Then they started telling her how to take advantage of them for her own purpose. Wary of following the letters first, she has now fully embraced the foresight of this mysterious messenger, allowing them to lead her in secret.

## Codex


The codex is a thick, heavy tome, bound in what seems to be rough, greenish-gray leather. Upon closer examination, the leather reveals itself to be dragonhide, subtly scaled, and carrying the faint smell of ancient ashes. The book's corners are reinforced with small plates of [[orium]], a metal reputedly created from dragon blood, each plate engraved with a stylized image of the three [[Progenitor Dragons]]: [[Progenitor Dragons#Khyber|Khyber]], [[Progenitor Dragons#Siberys|Siberys]], and [[Progenitor Dragons#Eberron|Eberron]], entwined in an eternal dance.

The pages of the codex are crafted from a high-quality parchment, resistant to the wear of time. When viewed under normal light, most of the pages appear blank, but when [[Professor Baelen ir'Torn|Baelen]] exposes them to the light refracted through an [[Dragonshards#^90b643|eberron dragonshard]], cryptic texts and diagrams come to life.

However, the full understanding of these entries remains elusive, as the completion of the text is only visible under the light of the yet-unacquired [[Dragonshards#^b906e5|Syberys]] and [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber]] shards. Baelen's continued research hinges on the acquisition of these rare components.



## Dragonshards


Dragonshards are fragments of the bodies of the progenitor dragons, and each type is associated with one of the dragons. These mystical stones have the ability to hold and channel magical energy, making them an integral part of many magical items and spells. They come in three types: Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron shards, each with unique characteristics and applications.

---

**Eberron Dragonshards**
Eberron shards, also known as "dragon's blood" (not to be confused with [[Dragon Blood]]) or bloodstones, are the most common type. They are typically found in rock formations or riverbeds across the world of Eberron. This shard's radiant, multicolored veins stand in stark contrast to its otherwise transparent exterior. Eberron shards are used to bind elemental creatures and power the mighty airships and lightning rails. They also play a vital role in the creation and operation of the Warforged and sentient constructs. ^90b643

---

**Siberys Dragonshards**
Siberys shards, or "dragon's tears", are the rarest and most coveted of the three. They are not found in the ground but instead fall from the Ring of Siberys that encircles the world. These shards are golden and exhibit a radiant glow. They are predominantly used for the creation of dragonmarks and serve as key components in the highest echelons of artifice. The Siberys shards are coveted by those with dragonmarks, as they can augment and enhance their powers. ^b906e5

---

**Khyber Dragonshards**
Khyber shards, known as "dragon's teeth", are found deep within the world, in the underdark and other subterranean locales. These shards have a sinister, dark hue, often perceived as an abyssal black or a deep blue. Khyber shards are used to create binding circles and magic items that contain or utilize fiends or other extraplanar entities. Their energy is considered potent but unpredictable, which often leads to their use in more nefarious magical applications. ^023b44



## Fractured Khyber Dragonshard

### House Jorasco


Leader: [[Ulara d'Jorasco]]
Emblem: Griffon
HQ: Vedkyar Enclave, [[Karrnath]]
Race: Halfling

---

House Jorasco is a prominent healing house in the world of Eberron, known for its exceptional skills in the art of healing and restoration. House Jorasco has been providing its services to the people of Khorvaire for centuries.

Thought House Jorasco will provide healing services to all who need it (and all who can afford it), there are rumors that House Jorasco worked with [[House Vadalis]] during the [[Last War]], potentially developing biological weapons.

---

Services Rendered:
1. Healing: House Jorasco offers various healing services to individuals who require immediate medical attention or long-term care. They have highly skilled healers proficient in both magical and non-magical methods of treatment.

2. Restoration: In addition to physical healing, House Jorasco also specializes in restoration services that focus on mental well-being. They provide counseling, therapy, and even magical treatments to help individuals recover from trauma or overcome mental health issues.

3. Disease Control: House Jorasco has dedicated teams working on disease control and prevention. They conduct research, develop vaccines, and offer consultations on how to maintain good health and prevent the spread of illnesses.

4. Training Programs: As part of their commitment to spreading knowledge and improving healthcare standards across Khorvaire, House Jorasco offers training programs for aspiring healers. These programs cover various aspects of medicine, from basic first aid to advanced magical healing techniques.

---

Prices:
The cost of services provided by House Jorasco varies depending on the severity of the condition, duration of treatment required, and ability to pay. However, Ulara d'Jorasco's vision is to ensure that healing and restoration services are accessible to all, regardless of their financial standing. As a result, House Jorasco operates on a sliding scale, offering discounted or even free services to those in need.

While the exact prices for specific treatments may vary, House Jorasco always strives to find a balance between sustaining their operations and fulfilling their mission of providing healing and restoration to all who seek it.

---

### Diamond Conspiracy
Immortality is bad for business. House Jorasco thrives on being the premier source of healing and ressurection, the latter part of which generates them a significant amount of money. Cheap ressurection isn't easy to come by - and House Jorasco leaders make sure it stays that way.

The lowest and most available form of true ressurection is _Revivify_. With access to a large diamond, any common cleric could perform ressurection services, potentially sucking away profits and renown from Jorasco clerics.

Did you know diamonds really aren't that hard to find? In fact, Eberron has a wealth of diamonds in it's cave systems. However, shady contracts, lobbying, and intimidation with governments and land owners has allowed House Jorasco to establish a near monopoly on diamond mining, allowing them to exponentially inflate their price.

This is a secret kept close to the House's chest, and they don't take kindly to purchased from unsanctioned dealers, nor do they enjoy lowly adventurers asking questions.

# Factions

## Dragons of Argonnessen


Argonnessen is known as the continent of dragons and is largely unexplored by the other races. Other humanoid races do occupy these lands, but they serve the dragons, often by capturing or killing those who wash up on the shoreline either purposefully or by accident.

---

## The Council
The Council's primary role is to oversee the [[Draconic Prophecy]], an intricate web of predictions about the world's future that is written in constellations, geography, and living beings' life paths. They are also tasked with ensuring that draconic society in Argonnessen remains stable and secure.

While all dragons have a certain degree of interest in the Prophecy, it's the Council that actively studies its many threads and makes decisions based on their interpretations. Their decisions can have far-reaching effects due to their long lifespan and powerful magic abilities.

The Council also serves as a sort of diplomatic body for dealing with non-dragon entities. They are known to be isolationist, preferring to keep Argonnessen free from outside influence. However, they will engage with other races if they believe it serves their interests or if it pertains to an aspect of the Draconic Prophecy.

It's important to note that while they hold great power within draconic society, not all dragons agree with or follow their rulings universally. Dragons are independent creatures by nature, so while some respect and adhere to the Council's decisions, others choose their own path.

---

## The Day of Mourning
The [[Day of Mourning]] was direct  result of actions that were taken by the Dragons of Argonnessen to prevent the [[Overlords]] from being freed from their prisons of the [[Silver Flame]]. Would the war have been allowed to reach its climax, the total conflict, violence, and devastation would have allowed certain Overlords to grow too strong for their bonds.

## Day of Mourning


The age of demons exposed the world to the power of the Overlords. Great, terrifying, and nearly unstoppable, a single overlord freed of its bonds can assert its domain across an entire country. 

The [[Dragons of Argonnessen]], combined with the full force of the [[Couatl]], waged a war against the Overlords. Weaving the threads of the [[Prophecy]], the Couatl sacrificed their collective life force to form the [[Silver Flame]], forever imprisoning the Overlords by separating their consciousness from their Heart Demi-planes.

Thought they can be imprisoned, the Children of Khyber can never be defeated. In modern times, with the [[Last War|Last War's]] destruction threatening to plunge the entirety of Khorvaire into chaos, certain Overlords that feed off this violence grow strong. 

Knowing that to allow this war to continue would be to release the most dangerous of the Children of Khyber, the Dragons of Argonnessen decided to use their ancient magic to stifle the life of [[Cyre]], knowing it would bring an end to the Last War and disrupt the Overlords' plans.

Should a similar situation arise in the future, [[Dragons of Argonnessen#^e57023|The Council]] will not hesitate to use their terrible and awesome power again to bring stability and maintain order in the face of absolute destruction.

## Progenitor Dragons


The Progenitor Dragons of Eberron cosmology are fabled entities born of the primal forces that shape existence. They are Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron.

Bound by the interplay of Order and Dissonance, they are emblematic of the fundamental principles of reality. Their eternal conflict and harmonious coexistence are mirrored in the world around, shaping its laws, magic, and the very nature of existence itself. Despite the struggle, there remains a delicate balance, upheld by the Heartstone. The myths and legends surrounding these entities permeate the cultures and religions of Eberron, influencing both reverence and fear.

---

## Siberys
Born of Order, Siberys, known as the Dragon Above, is depicted as an immense celestial dragon with scales of pure gold that shimmer like countless stars. As the embodiment of [[Order]], Siberys seeks to impose structure and constancy upon the universe. This force gave shape to the cosmos and solidified the laws of nature and magic.

## Khyber
Representing [[Dissonance]], Khyber, the Dragon Below, is envisaged as a shifting, spectral dragon, its form woven from shadows and chaos. It represents the force of change and unpredictability, constantly striving to disrupt the order imposed by Siberys and usher in transformation and diversity.

## Eberron
Born of both Order and Dissonance, Eberron, the Dragon Between, represents the world itself. It is depicted as a dragon of diverse colors, mirroring the various elements of the material world it embodies. Eberron emerged from the interplay of Order and Dissonance, embodying both in a harmonious balance.
##
---

~~The Heartstone, according to legend, is said to reside deep within Eberron. A small, pulsing crystal, it is believed to be the heart of the Dragon Between, mediating the forces of Siberys and Khyber. It is said that Eberron willingly gave part of its life force, crystallizing it into the Heartstone to ensure the continued existence of all creation.~~



## Prophecy


_The falling of a tree, the flap of a butterflies wings, the whispers of wind in man's ear. It is not known what drove the author to create such an eternal document, nor is it known who created it. That's what unique about chaos - sometimes, things just happen_.
-[[Professor Baelen ir'Torn]]

---
~~"When stars in heaven's canvas align,  
Under dragon's heart and prophecy's sign,  
The ancient stone of creators three,  
Shall ignite a dawn for all to see.~~

~~In harmony's fall and dissonance's rise,  
A realm of twilight beneath the skies,  
Mourning shall sweep across the land,  
Unleashed by a regretful dragon's hand.~~

~~Through trials of fire, steel, and lore,  
Thee will stand at the chaos door.  
From echoes of the past, the truth they'll glean,  
To quell the storm that lies unseen."~~
^a74a88
---
# Functionality
The prophecy isnt one document that tells of all that will be. Its more like an observation of specific circumstances that give a series of if-then statements in regard to the universe. Only an ancient or powerful being may have the knowledge to interpret these signs into any useful knowledge.



# Lore

## Dragon Blood


_"Dragon's Blood is a magical phenomenon unlike any other. It enables the user to tap into a crude, unstable form of the primal forces of magic. But like handling raw elemental forces, the risks far outweigh the fleeting benefits. This drug not only wreaks havoc on the user's physical form but also destabilizes the very magical essence of their being. The uncontrolled magical outbursts are akin to trying to direct a thunderstorm with a tin roof - unpredictable, chaotic, and more often than not, disastrous."_
-Illicit Magical Substance (IMS) researcher, [[Morgrave University]]

---

Dragon Blood, also known as Blood or Heat, is an illegal substance commonly found in the lower levels of [[Sharn]]. In its raw form, it is a thick, iridescent liquid that shifts color in the light, reminiscent of an oil slick or a soap bubble. It is typically consumed by dropping the liquid onto the tongue, where it absorbs quickly into the bloodstream, causing an immediate and potent effect.

Users often describe the initial effects as a sensation of warmth spreading throughout the body, a quickening of the senses, and an unexplainable feeling of being deeply connected to the mystical weave of magic that permeates the world. Regular users become addicted, not just to the drug's effects but also to the feeling of power and the illusions of insight into the magical world around them.

However, the drug's long-term effects can be devastating. Prolonged use of Dragon's Blood results in physical deterioration and mental instability, as the body struggles to cope with the sudden influx of magical energy. It can lead to hallucinations, erratic behavior, and in the worst cases, wild magical outbursts.

---

The following is a table of random magical effects Dragon's Blood might trigger:

1. The user emits a bright light in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute.
2. For the next minute, any spell cast by the user targets a random creature within range.
3. The user's skin turns bright blue for 24 hours.
4. The user can only speak in rhymes for the next hour.
5. The user's size increases by one category for 1 minute.
6. The user is invisible for the next minute or until they attack or cast a spell.
7. The user gains a flying speed equal to their walking speed for 1 minute.
8. The user immediately casts Fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on themselves.
9. For the next minute, all the user's melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage.
10. The user is affected as if by the Polymorph spell, transformed into a sheep for the duration.

## Anonymous Letters


A minion of an overlord has been using the prophecy to send letters to Thora Tarkanan in hopes of starting a complete civil war within the city that will lead to total war throughout Khorvaire.

## Jonston's Note


This piece of worn parchment has obviously seen the wear-and-tear of an active lifestyle. If Jon was killed it also has some blood smears on it.

> Dear Jonny,
> 
> I miss you so much since you left town. The house feels empty without your laughter filling it up. I hope you are doing okay on your travels. 
> 
> Things have been odd around here lately. The animals have been riled up, especially at night. Folks say they hear weird noises coming from the Whitehorn Woods. I'm sure it's nothing to worry over, but it would be nice to have you home. 
> 
> I'm going to bake your favorite blueberry pie for when you visit. I can't wait to see your smiling face and hear about your adventures. Please be careful and come back soon. You're always in my prayers.

### Plans


## Airship Crash
Traveling on a merchant airship for their own reasons, the PCs become involved in a mid-air battle against pirates, which inevitably leads to the ship crashing, with the PCs as some of the very few survivors.

The first session will consist of the airship introduction, battle, and crash. Then they must navigate the wreckage sight, maneuver around or fight the pirates looting the wreckage and torturing the survivors, and embark on their own journey to Sharn.

## Airship
The PCs are traveling aboard a merchant airship powered by an air elemental contained within a Khyber crystal. Other magitech enhances and controls the power of the elemental to make the ship fly. Destruction or dislodgement of this crystal would send the ship crashing to the ground.

The ship embarked from [[Fairhaven]], [[Aundair]], hauling mostly typical supplies and food. Each PC should have their own reason for traveling to Sharn, along with methods to get on board the expensive airship.

In the middle of the night the airship is attacked by Kobold pirates hailing from Drooam.

The ship will crash just south of Drum Keep. Captain Marsh's home is a half-day travel west in Shavalant

On the ship are 4 [[Statblocks#Veteran|Veteran]] guards and 8 [[Statblocks#Commoner|Commoner]] workers. They also have a mounted [[Statblocks#Balista|Balista]].

Crew:
- Jonston Marsh - red Tiefling Captain
- Lick - Halfling First mate

## Pirates
The attack pirates consist of 1 [[Statblocks#Kobold Scale Sorcerer|Kobold Scale Sorcerer]] and 6 [[Statblocks#Pteranodon|Pteranodons]], with 2 [[Statblocks#Kobold|Kobolds]] riding each except for one, which is ridden by the Kobold Scale sorcerer. 

The pirates begin the attack with the sorcerer throwing a schorching ray at the ship, targeting the navigation system and Khyber crystal.  They then drop 2 kobolds off the backs of their mounts onto the deck, which start attacking. Each round a kobold riding a pteranodon will make a fly-by attack. In addition, a new kobold will be dropped off on the deck at the top of each round. 

After several rounds, the rear of the ship gets engulfed in fire, and the ship starts to go down. It drops in the Dagger river, allowing the players to survive relatively unscathed. 

## After the crash
- The crash site is in a forest clearing, with debris and wreckage scattered around. Bodies of crew members and passengers are strewn about.
- There are several kobold warriors scavenging the wreckage for valuables. They are opportunistic and will attack the PCs on sight.
- In the command deck ruins, the PCs find the injured first mate who tells them other survivors fled into the woods chased by kobolds. 
- As the PCs search for survivors, they will encounter kobold search parties (groups of 2d4 kobolds).
- After 2 encounters, they come to a narrowing in the river where they can spot Captain March being beaten by laughing kobolds.
- Across the river is the sorcerer leader and his remaining 2 Pteranodon riders, holding the captain captive and beating him. They don't notice the PCs initially, but if they aren't stopped quickly they will kill the captain.

### Jonston Marsh

### Overview


1. **Tensions in the City of Towers are at an all time high.** With [[Dragonmarked Houses]], criminal organizations, and the Sharn government all at each others throats, a city-wide war could erupt with a single wrong move from any involved. Significant reasons for tension:
	- A week ago, [[Saidan Boromar]] began to suffer from an "illness" that kept him bed bound. The [[Boromar clan]] has since been quiet on his whereabouts, however many suspect he is actually dead, and those in the clan are attempting to figure out how to stop the house from crumbling.
	- Daask has recently increased the frequency and boldness of their attacks, sensing the weakness of the Boromars.
2. **The Boromar clan is slipping into dismay**
	- The death of Saidan has lead to the rise of two factions within the clan: Those that support the succession of [[Castar]] - his chief advisor, and those that support [[Halak Boromar]]- his chief enforcement officer. 
3. **The assassination of [[Shassa Tarr]]**
	1. Council Woman Shassa Tarr  played a vital role in keeping the smaller underground organizations from warring with each other. Her death may just be where the immense tension outgrows its precarious perch of peace.
4. [[Loro Cass]] attempts to recruit the party into looking into [[House Tarkanan]] to find out what happened to his daughter.

#### Blackstone Church


## General Information

**Location and Architecture**: The Blackstone Church, named for its dark, foreboding exterior, is situated within the chaotic expanse of the [[Dragoneyes District]]. Its sturdy construction is a testament to an era gone by, providing shelter to those in need. Its towering spires can be seen from a distance, and its heavy doors promise protection from the chaotic streets.

**History**: Having been founded before the collapse of Old Sharn, the church is one of the oldest standing structures that remains in the City of Towers. This is a testament to the strength and wisdom needed to be a priest of this church. It is a rare and very highly respected position. Even organized criminal organizations tend to respect the boundary of the massive wooden doors.

**Leader - Brother Garrow**: A half-orc cleric of strong conviction, Brother Garrow leads the Blackstone Church with a mixture of stern discipline and compassionate wisdom. His past may be marred with violence in defense of this ancient monestary, but his present is dedicated to peace and sanctuary. Garrow's guidance is sought by many within the area, and he has become a beacon of stability in an otherwise turbulent district.

**Religious Practices**: The Blackstone Church worships the [[Church of the Silver Flame]], however they welcome all that wish to attend. Since the Silver Flame practices an ideology rather than worshipping a particular god, they do not push away the worship of other deities. Pilgrims and locals alike are welcome to attend, and many find solace in the safe amd structured environment.

**Community and Services**: The church provides more than just spiritual guidance. It serves as a shelter for those in need, providing food, warmth, and safety. Many destitute and desperate individuals find refuge within its walls, and the clergy works tirelessly to aid those who have lost their way.

**Relationship with Dragoneyes**: Being a bastion of order in Dragoneyes is no small feat. The church's principles often clash with the lawless nature of the district, making it a target for various criminal elements. However, the respect Brother Garrow commands, along with the church's long-standing presence, has created a delicate balance. Many organized crime factions in Dragoneyes recognize the value of the sanctuary it provides, allowing it to exist within this tumultuous region.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Unseen Threat**: There have been reports of strange, unseen forces causing mischief within the walls of Blackstone Church, disrupting services and scaring worshippers. Brother Garrow believes it's a malevolent spirit and asks for help in exorcising it.

2. **The Sacred Artifact**: An ancient religious artifact thought to be lost has resurfaced on the black market. This artifact is of great significance to the Church and Brother Garrow enlists the aid of the players to retrieve it without causing an uproar.

3. **Protection from Gangs**: A local gang has started harassing people seeking refuge at the Blackstone Church. The players might witness Brother Garrow attempting to pay these thugs to leave the church and its people unharmed, so that he may avoid more violence.

4. **The False Prophet**: A charismatic stranger has started preaching blasphemy outside the church, drawing away believers and stirring up trouble with his radical teachings of [[The Travelor]].

5. **The Secret Passage**: During renovations, a hidden passage is discovered beneath the church leading into an unknown part of Sharn's undercity. 

6. **Brother Garrow's Past**: Someone from Brother Garrow's violent past reappears threatening to reveal secrets that could ruin his reputation and destabilize his position within the church unless he pays a hefty sum of gold. He may be looking for ways to make this person go away.
   
7. **Rituals Gone Wrong**: During a routine ritual at Blackstone Church, something goes horribly wrong causing strange phenomena or summoning an evil creature.
   
8. **Silver Flame Pilgrimage**: Once every decade, members of Blackstone Church embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to renew their faith in Silver Flame at a distant shrine located in treacherous terrain filled with hostile creatures. Brother Garrow is keeping an eye out for a devotee to take care of the church while he is away.
  
9. **Cursed Donation**: A wealthy but shady benefactor donates a large sum of money for charity work but soon after terrible luck starts plaguing Blackstone Church; accidents happen, people fall ill and there is general unease among devotees suspecting that the donation might have been cursed.


## NPCs

1. **Brother Garrow**: The half-orc cleric and leader of Blackstone Church is often found within its walls, offering guidance and support to his flock.
 ^19fb4c
2. **Sister Maelis**: A human nun who helps run the church’s soup kitchen and provides medical aid to those in need.

3. **Thorne**: A grizzled dwarf who serves as the church’s caretaker and handyman, often seen repairing broken pews or tending to the grounds.

4. **Novice Lark**: A young halfling acolyte, eager to learn about the Silver Flame and help wherever he can.

5. Knowledge: A young warforged that was once lost on the streets with no path, Knowledge was taken in by Brother Garrow and given a new purpose - to read through old manuscripts and educate himself and others on the rich history of the Blackstone Church. 




#### Dragoneyes District


The Dragoneyes District is located on the western side of [[Sharn]], in the lower levels of [[Tavick's Landing]]. It is notorious for its large population of immigrants from the continent of Xen'drik, primarily Drow, Shifters, and Golieths. The district also houses a significant number of shifters, goblins, and changelings. The architecture here is diverse and exotic, reflecting the various cultures that have found a home in this part of the city.

#### Sharn


## Overview

Sharn, also known as the "City of Towers," is a thriving metropolis located in the southeast of Khorvaire. It is the largest city in the continent and is known for its magical towers that reach high into the sky, earning its nickname. Sharn is an eclectic city, brimming with different races, cultures, and factions.

## Districts

### Central Plateau
The Central Plateau is the heart of Sharn, housing the city's major political, financial and educational institutions. The district is distinguished by its grand architecture and towering skyscrapers, reflecting the city's magical and technological advancements. It is also home to many of Sharn's elite, with upscale residences and luxurious amenities.

#### Upper Central Plateau
The most prestigious district in Sharn where nobility and wealthy citizens reside. Notable locations include Citadel Tower (home to Sharn’s Watch) and Morgrave University.

#### Middle Central Plateau
This area houses middle-class citizens and various businesses. It's also home to several academies and libraries.

#### Lower Central Plateau
The Lower Central Plateau is filled with markets, shops, taverns, and working-class residences. It's often bustling with activity day or night.

### The Cogs
Located below the city proper, The Cogs are a network of massive tunnels filled with factories and forges. This district houses much of Sharn's industry as well as its poorest citizens.

### Menthis Plateau
An entertainment hub boasting theaters, restaurants, casinos, and sports arenas. The famous Torchfire theatre can be found here.

### Dura
One of the oldest districts in Sharn, Dura is a rough and tumble area home to working-class citizens, immigrants, and a fair share of shady characters. The district is divided into Upper, Middle and Lower Dura.

#### Upper Dura
Upper Dura is home to middle-class citizens and is one of the more stable areas in Dura. It houses a number of schools, small businesses, and residential buildings. Notable locations include Daggerwatch Garrison and Stronghold Park.

#### Middle Dura
Middle Dura is filled with hardworking lower-class citizens, many of whom work in the nearby factories or docks. It's often bustling with activity day or night, with various taverns and markets scattered throughout.

#### Lower Dura
Lower Dura is known for its rough reputation. Rife with crime and poverty, it's home to a large portion of Sharn's underclass. Despite this, it also has a strong sense of community among its residents. The Bazaar district in Lower Dura is well-known for its affordable goods.

### Cliffside
Located on the steep cliffs that edge the city to the south, Cliffside offers breathtaking views but precarious living conditions. Filled with sailors, dockworkers, and those drawn by the allure of adventure or escape from law enforcement.

### Tarvick’s Landing
A major transport hub filled with rail stations, airship docks and warehouses. This district keeps Sharn connected with other parts of Khorvaire both by land and air. Home to a diverse mix of inhabitants from traveling merchants to dock workers.

### The Depths
Below even The Cogs lies The Depths - a place shrouded in mystery & danger that few venture into willingly. Home to ancient ruins & creatures best left undisturbed; this area serves as a reminder of what lies beneath Sharn’s grandeur.

## Points of Interest

### Morgrave University
Founded by Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave, it’s known for its extensive collection of relics and artifacts from all over Eberron.

### Torchfire Theatre 
Home to world-renowned playwrights and actors. It’s a symbol of culture in Sharn where people flock to witness grand performances.

### Citadel Tower 
Headquarters of Sharn’s Watch and base for the city guard. It’s one of the most secured locations in the city.

## Society & Culture

Sharn is a melting pot where cultures from across Eberron mingle. Its residents include humans, elves, dwarves, changelings, warforged - even members of more exotic races like goblins or tieflings can be found here. This diversity is reflected in every aspect of life in Sharn from its cuisine to its architecture.

Despite this diversity though, social inequality runs deep in Sharn with a clear divide between those who live in its soaring towers versus those who dwell beneath them in The Cogs or The Depths. This tension frequently leads to conflicts but also fuels much of the city's vibrant art scene as well as its ceaseless political intrigue.

## Travel
### Travel Time
Travel in Sharn can be unpredictable. Residents joke that it takes about an hour to get anywhere, whether it’s just down three levels in the same tower or all the way across town. Of course, skycoaches reduce the time dramatically compared to walking from place to place, and characters who really know their way around (as well as characters who are willing to ask for directions frequently along the way) can get to their destinations more quickly than newcomers who refuse to display their ignorance. 

If it becomes important to know how long it takes to get from one place to another, use the following rules of thumb:

|Mode of Travel and Destination|Travel Time*|
|---|---|
|Foot Travel||
|Destination in same district|3d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|6d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|3d6 × 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|6d6 × 5 minutes|
|Flying Travel||
|Destination in same district|1d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|2d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|1d6 × 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|2d6 × 5 minutes|

- A party can reduce this time by one-half if one character makes a successful DC 15 Knowledge (local) or Gather Information check

- Numbers in parentheses are for magebred horses with the swift breed special quality

### Travel Prices
For general travel prices, refer to the [[Tables#Travel Prices|Travel Prices table.]]

#### Tarvick's Market


The Bazaar is a sprawling marketplace perched atop of a series of intersecting bridges that connect various towers in middle [[Tarvick's Landing]]. Filled with diverse populations seeking a plethora of goods, this area is notorious for its exotic smells and interesting "people watching" opportunities. 

Being located in Tarvick's Landing, this market caters to a very diverse population, including a large subset of shifters, changelings, and Cyran refugees. The food and culture here reflects that, and most here won't take a second glance at a type of people that they've never seen before.

The Sharn watch has a larger presence here than most other places in the district, though its still small compared to other parts of the city. The [[Sharn Watch]] here is relatively fair and uncorrupt, thanks to the work of [[Iyanna ir'Talan]]. 

## Location

Tarvick's Market is situated in middle Tarvick's Landing, and its host to many different shops. Its main bazaar is situated on a series of intersecting bridges and platforms that form a large market square.

Being situated directly above [[Terminus]] allows for the goods being shipped in from across [[Khorvaire]] via lightning rale to shipped directly to the markets. As a result, several large magical lifts create passage ways from terminus to the upper districts, though they are rarely open to personal use.

Besides common methods of sky travel like [[Soarsleds]], [[Skycoaches]], and exotic mounts, normal methods of travel are possible via suspended buildings and roads and towers that serve only to act as a staircase upwards. These locations are commonly clogged with heavy foot traffic, though.

## Goods & Shops
Plenty of various goods flow through this marketplace, from high priced jewelry and magical items to simple food and supplies.  A large majority of farmers choose to set up their shops here, since the Bazaar of Dura is very dangerous and the North Market is expensive.

Some, but not most expensive magical items and other wares can be found here, though for the pricier items one may have to travel to somewhere like North Market.

## Plot Hooks
1. **Kobold Daask Attack**: A group of creature-riding kobolds from the monster-run criminal organization [[Daask]] shows up from the sky and attempts to rob the patrons of the bustling street market!

- When first arriving, the PCs overhear courtesans gossiping about a recent "dust-up" between clients affiliated with different factions.

- Noticing the PCs, a server "accidentally" spills a drink and mutters quick apologies, also slipping them a rolled up napkin with a message scrawled inside.

- If the PCs get into a bar fight, some thugs bear tattoos signifying they belong to one of the warring factions. Could be interrogated later for info.

- A secret door left slightly ajar reveals a room with documents strewn about detailing investigations into who has been assassinating higher-ups. No conclusive leads have been drawn.

- Strange noises lead the PCs to find a damp cellar room with shackles on the walls and the personal effects of someone important from a rival gang.

- A Tyrant guard pays special attention to the PCs, implying he knows they're looking for information and offers to broker a meeting with someone who can help, for the right price. 

- Madame Calderon herself sends the PCs a request to privately discuss business with someone new in town looking to make inroads with the Tyrants.

## Historic Treaty of Thronehold Ushers In New Era of Peace


The Treaty of Thronehold, a significant document promising to redefine the landscape of Khorvaire, has been signed. This landmark agreement signals the end of the Last War that has plagued our continent for over a century.

The signing ceremony took place in Thronehold Castle, the former seat of Galifar's power. Representatives from each of the twelve recognized nations set aside their bitterness and assembled to formally declare an end to hostilities. 

The Treaty delineates boundaries and acknowledges sovereignty, granting each nation its rightfully earned autonomy. These nations include Aundair, Breland, Cyre - now mournfully referred to as The Mournland - Darguun, Droaam, The Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, The Lhazaar Principalities, The Mror Holds, Q'Barra, The Talenta Plains and Thrane.

The agreement also declares that House Cannith will dismantle Creation Forges across Khorvaire and cease Warforged production henceforth. This clause aims to prevent any future escalation of conflict by stemming the creation of magically manufactured soldiers.

Furthermore, it recognizes Warforged as sentient beings with rights equal to those enjoyed by other denizens of Khorvaire. This groundbreaking recognition marks a progressive step in our continent's history.

However, the treaty leaves several contentious issues unresolved. Notably absent are provisions addressing war reparations or specific terms for demilitarization. Additionally, several regions and factions remain unrecognized by the Treaty; this includes Shadow Marches and Valenar who argue for their sovereignty.

While critics express concerns over these omissions potentially sowing seeds for future conflicts; optimists view this as an opportunity for continuing diplomatic negotiations in a newfound atmosphere of peace.

The Treaty signifies not only an end but also a new beginning – a chance for our war-torn continent to heal its wounds and move towards unity and prosperity. It is indeed a monumental milestone in Khorvaire’s history which we should all cherish cautiously while working towards establishing lasting peace.


## Skyway's Floating Gardens Flourish with Rare Flora


In a delightful spectacle of nature's resilience, Skyway's floating gardens have become home to a rare species of luminescent flowers, previously thought to be native only to the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. The flowers, known as Starlight Blossoms, have begun to bloom in the high towers of [[Sharn]], casting an enchanting glow over the city's skyline.

The sudden appearance of these flowers has sparked mild curiosity among the citizens and a few scholarly debates in [[Morgrave University|Morgrave University's]] hallowed halls. Botanists are intrigued by how these flowers, typically found in the mystical groves of the Eldeen Reaches, have adapted to the urban environment of Sharn.

In the political landscape, this event has been largely met with passive interest. Some members of the [[Aurum]] have taken to decorating their estates with these glowing blossoms, viewing them as a status symbol. Meanwhile, [[House Vadalis]], bearers of the Mark of Handling and known for their expertise in flora and fauna, have expressed a desire to study these flowers further.

While the Starlight Blossoms' arrival is a minor event in the grand scheme of Sharn's bustling life, it serves as a gentle reminder of the world's enduring magic and mystery. As the city continues its daily hustle and bustle, the Starlight Blossoms glow quietly, adding a touch of serene beauty to the City of Towers.
