Argonnessen is known as the continent of dragons and is largely unexplored by the other races. Other humanoid races do occupy these lands, but they serve the dragons, often by capturing or killing those who wash up on the shoreline either purposefully or by accident.

## The Chamber
[[The Chamber|The Chamber's]] primary role is to oversee the [[Draconic Prophecy]], an intricate web of predictions about the world's future that is written in constellations, geography, and living beings' life paths. They are also tasked with ensuring that draconic society in Argonnessen remains stable and secure.

While all dragons have a certain degree of interest in the Prophecy, it's the Chamber that actively studies its many threads and makes decisions based on their interpretations. Their decisions can have far-reaching effects due to their long lifespan and powerful magic abilities.

The Chamber also serves as a sort of diplomatic body for dealing with non-dragon entities. They are known to be isolationist, preferring to keep Argonnessen free from outside influence. However, they will engage with other races if they believe it serves their interests or if it pertains to an aspect of the Draconic Prophecy.

It's important to note that while they hold great power within draconic society, not all dragons agree with or follow their rulings universally. Dragons are independent creatures by nature, so while some respect and adhere to the Council's decisions, others choose their own path.

## The Day of Mourning
The [[Day of Mourning]] was direct  result of actions that were taken by the Dragons of Argonnessen to prevent the [[Overlords]] from being freed from their prisons of the [[Silver Flame]]. Would the war have been allowed to reach its climax, the total conflict, violence, and devastation would have allowed certain Overlords to grow too strong for their bonds.
