1. **Tensions in the City of Towers are at an all time high.** With [[Dragonmarked Houses]], criminal organizations, and the Sharn government all at each others throats, a city-wide war could erupt with a single wrong move from any involved. Significant reasons for tension:
	- A week ago, [[Saidan Boromar]] began to suffer from an "illness" that kept him bed bound. The [[Boromar clan]] has since been quiet on his whereabouts, however many suspect he is actually dead, and those in the clan are attempting to figure out how to stop the house from crumbling.
	- Daask has recently increased the frequency and boldness of their attacks, sensing the weakness of the Boromars.
2. **The Boromar clan is slipping into dismay**
	- The death of Saidan has lead to the rise of two factions within the clan: Those that support the succession of Castar - his chief advisor, and those that support Halak Boromar - his chief enforcement officer. 
3. **The party witnesses the assassination of [[Shassa Tarr]]**
	1. Council Woman Shassa Tarr  played a vital role in keeping the smaller underground organizations from warring with each other. Her death may just be where the immense tension outgrows its precarious perch of peace.
4. [[Loro Cass]] attempts to recruit the party into looking into either [[The Tyrants]] or [[House Tarkanan]] to find out what happened to his daughter.

	2. [[The Beggar King|The Beggar King's]] spies notice what the PCs are searching for, and are willing to offer information if it aids in the downfall of House Tarkanan.
