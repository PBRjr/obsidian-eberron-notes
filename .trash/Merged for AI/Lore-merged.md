# Progenitor Dragons


The Progenitor Dragons of Eberron cosmology are fabled entities born of the primal forces that shape existence. They are Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron.

Bound by the interplay of Order and Dissonance, they are emblematic of the fundamental principles of reality. Their eternal conflict and harmonious coexistence are mirrored in the world around, shaping its laws, magic, and the very nature of existence itself. Despite the struggle, there remains a delicate balance, upheld by the Heartstone. The myths and legends surrounding these entities permeate the cultures and religions of Eberron, influencing both reverence and fear.

---

## Siberys
Born of Order, Siberys, known as the Dragon Above, is depicted as an immense celestial dragon with scales of pure gold that shimmer like countless stars. As the embodiment of [[Order]], Siberys seeks to impose structure and constancy upon the universe. This force gave shape to the cosmos and solidified the laws of nature and magic.

## Khyber
Representing [[Dissonance]], Khyber, the Dragon Below, is envisaged as a shifting, spectral dragon, its form woven from shadows and chaos. It represents the force of change and unpredictability, constantly striving to disrupt the order imposed by Siberys and usher in transformation and diversity.

## Eberron
Born of both Order and Dissonance, Eberron, the Dragon Between, represents the world itself. It is depicted as a dragon of diverse colors, mirroring the various elements of the material world it embodies. Eberron emerged from the interplay of Order and Dissonance, embodying both in a harmonious balance.

~~The Heartstone, according to legend, is said to reside deep within Eberron. A small, pulsing crystal, it is believed to be the heart of the Dragon Between, mediating the forces of Siberys and Khyber. It is said that Eberron willingly gave part of its life force, crystallizing it into the Heartstone to ensure the continued existence of all creation.~~



# Day of Mourning


The age of demons exposed the world to the power of the Overlords. Great, terrifying, and nearly unstoppable, a single overlord freed of its bonds can assert its domain across an entire country. 

The [[Dragons of Argonnessen]], combined with the full force of the [[Couatl]], waged a war against the Overlords. Weaving the threads of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], the Couatl sacrificed their collective life force to form the [[Silver Flame]], forever imprisoning the Overlords by separating their consciousness from their Heart Demi-planes.

Thought they can be imprisoned, the Children of Khyber can never be defeated. In modern times, with the [[Last War|Last War's]] destruction threatening to plunge the entirety of Khorvaire into chaos, certain Overlords that feed off this violence grow strong. 

Knowing that to allow this war to continue would be to release the most dangerous of the Children of Khyber, the Dragons of Argonnessen decided to use their ancient magic to stifle the life of [[Cyre]], knowing it would bring an end to the Last War and disrupt the Overlords' plans.

Should a similar situation arise in the future, [[Dragons of Argonnessen#^e57023|The Council]] will not hesitate to use their terrible and awesome power again to bring stability and maintain order in the face of absolute destruction.

# Dragons of Argonnessen


Argonnessen is known as the continent of dragons and is largely unexplored by the other races. Other humanoid races do occupy these lands, but they serve the dragons, often by capturing or killing those who wash up on the shoreline either purposefully or by accident.

---

## The Council
The Council's primary role is to oversee the [[Draconic Prophecy]], an intricate web of predictions about the world's future that is written in constellations, geography, and living beings' life paths. They are also tasked with ensuring that draconic society in Argonnessen remains stable and secure.

While all dragons have a certain degree of interest in the Prophecy, it's the Council that actively studies its many threads and makes decisions based on their interpretations. Their decisions can have far-reaching effects due to their long lifespan and powerful magic abilities.

The Council also serves as a sort of diplomatic body for dealing with non-dragon entities. They are known to be isolationist, preferring to keep Argonnessen free from outside influence. However, they will engage with other races if they believe it serves their interests or if it pertains to an aspect of the Draconic Prophecy.

It's important to note that while they hold great power within draconic society, not all dragons agree with or follow their rulings universally. Dragons are independent creatures by nature, so while some respect and adhere to the Council's decisions, others choose their own path.

---

## The Day of Mourning
The [[Day of Mourning]] was direct  result of actions that were taken by the Dragons of Argonnessen to prevent the [[Overlords]] from being freed from their prisons of the [[Silver Flame]]. Would the war have been allowed to reach its climax, the total conflict, violence, and devastation would have allowed certain Overlords to grow too strong for their bonds.

# Prophecy


_The falling of a tree, the flap of a butterflies wings, the whispers of wind in man's ear. It is not known what drove the author to create such an eternal document, nor is it known who created it. That's what unique about chaos - sometimes, things just happen_.
-[[Professor Baelen ir'Torn]]

~~"When stars in heaven's canvas align,  
Under dragon's heart and prophecy's sign,  
The ancient stone of creators three,  
Shall ignite a dawn for all to see.~~

~~In harmony's fall and dissonance's rise,  
A realm of twilight beneath the skies,  
Mourning shall sweep across the land,  
Unleashed by a regretful dragon's hand.~~

~~Through trials of fire, steel, and lore,  
Thee will stand at the chaos door.  
From echoes of the past, the truth they'll glean,  
To quell the storm that lies unseen."~~

# Functionality
The prophecy isnt one document that tells of all that will be. Its more like an observation of specific circumstances that give a series of if-then statements in regard to the universe. Only an ancient or powerful being may have the knowledge to interpret these signs into any useful knowledge.
