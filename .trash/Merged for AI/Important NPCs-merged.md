**Backstory**: A lower-ranking member of [[House Cannith]], Aeren has always been more interested in uncovering the secrets of the past than in creating the future. This curiosity led him to start a side gig as an information broker, where his knack for piecing together bits of information has served him well, particularly by trading secrets in the [[Sharn underground]].

# Loro Cass


A broken and small middle aged halfling adult, Loro lost his daughter Monte several months ago when [[House Tarkanan]] attacked a [[The Tyrants|Tyrant]] safehouse with mourn weapons. Loro and his daughter were walking down a road when they were caught in the crossfire of such an attack. Barely escaping with his own life, Monte was struck by a beam of mysterious energy and disappeared, leaving no clue as to what exactly happened to her. 

His life now concerned with research into the organizations involved, Loro was lead to [[The Dragon's Breath Tavern]], where he overheard talk of something happening at the festival of [[Wildnight]]. This lead him to attend the festivities, keeping an eye out for anything suspicious. He happens to be in the area when the assassination takes place.

Witnessing the party deal with that situation may lead him to beg for their help in finding out what happened to his daughter.

# Marix d'Cannith


**Name**: Marix d'Cannith

**Race**: Human

Faction: Leader of [[Cannith South]]

**Class**: Artificer (Alchemist)

**Alignment**: Lawful Neutral

**Appearance**: Marix is a middle-aged man with greying hair and sharp, observant blue eyes. He carries the well-groomed look of a man of high standing, always dressed in the polished attire of [[House Cannith]]. His hands are calloused from years of detailed work.

---

**Personality**: Marix is driven and curious with a side of arrogance. He has a deep fascination with the Mourning's energies and firmly believes he can harness it for the betterment of House Cannith.

**Backstory**: Since the [[Day of Mourning]] nearly collapsed the once great House Cannith, the remains of nobility within struggle to rebuild. An intelligent alchemist and brilliant entrepreneur, Marix rose to the top of [[Cannith South]] by way of strategic business deals and new inventions. 

After discovering that a combination of rare metals and [[Dragonshards]] can harness the chaotic energies of the [[Mournland]], Marix started creating nearly uncontrollable and powerful weapons that he hopes will propel him to the top of the new unified House Cannith.

**Motivations**: Marix wants to elevate [[House Cannith]] and himself by mastering Mourning energy. However, his experiments have become increasingly dangerous as he struggles to control this unpredictable force. In order to test his new weaponry, he sells it to [[House Tarkanan]] with the expectation that they will secretly report back their findings.

---

**Roleplay Tips**: Play Marix as proud but increasingly desperate. He genuinely believes in his work's potential and is dismissive of any attempts to convince him of its dangers. As the campaign progresses and his control over the Mourning energy wanes, he might become more unstable and frantic.

Marix detests the leaders of his sister houses, and feels that he should be the one to unify Cannith and reestablish its place as the leader of the [[Dragonmarked Houses]].

---

**Relevant Information**: Marix is a stepping stone to the main plot. His experiments with Mourning energy are causing disruptions around Sharn, making him a target for investigation by the party.

**Connections**: 
Marix is supplying House Tarkanan with experimental weaponry fueled by Mourning energy.

~~Marix's actions indirectly lead to [[Aeren d'Cannith]]'s discovery of the coded documents about the [[Heartstone]], pushing the party towards uncovering the truth about the Day of Mourning.~~

# Thora Tarkanan


Name: Thora Tarkanan
Race: Human
Faction: Leader of [[House Tarkanan]]
Class/Statblock: 
Alignment: Neutral Evil

---

**Appearance**: Thora is a striking figure with an erect posture that speaks to her authority. Her short hair is neatly braided, and she possesses captivating yellow eyes. A notable aberrant dragonmark graces her left forearm, marking her as a member of the infamous House Tarkanan.

**Mannerism**: One cannot help but notice Thora's distinct manner of speech. She enunciates each word with excessive clarity, which only adds to her commanding presence.

---

**Occupation/History**: Thora Tarkanan is the esteemed leader of House Tarkanan, carrying on the legacy of her great-great-grandfather, Lord [[Halas Tarkanan]]. She stands as a beacon of power and influence within her house.

**Abilities**: Despite lacking in physical strength or constitution, Thora more than makes up for it with her sharp intellect and charismatic personality. She possesses an uncanny ability to command attention and respect from those around her.

**Talent**: Thora is a linguist at heart. She has a talent for languages and is fluent in several tongues, making her an excellent communicator and negotiator.

---

**Motivations**: For Thora, leading House Tarkanan is her sole purpose. Seeing it return to its once ultimate power is her driving motivation, and everything else is secondary.

**Methods**: Years ago, Thora began receiving [[Anonymous Letters|letters]] from an anonymous source which unexplainably predicted certain events. Then they started telling her how to take advantage of them for her own purpose. Wary of following the letters first, she has now fully embraced the foresight of this mysterious messenger, allowing them to lead her in secret.

# The Beggar King


The enigmatic figure known as the Beggar King rose from the impoverished streets of [[Sharn|Sharn's]] lower wards to become a major player within the [[Sharn underground]]. His true name and history are unknown - he is a disfigured, secretive individual whose body is covered in dozens of tiny, warped [[dragonmarks]] that grant him an eclectic array of magical abilities. This "mark madness", along with his fearsome street reputation, earned him the moniker "Beggar King."

The Beggar King runs an intelligence network of urchins, beggars and street thieves across Sharn called the [["Eyes of the King"]] that provides him invaluable insights into the city's workings. He is highly ambitious and sees House Tarkanan as a path to greater power and influence, ruthlessly manipulating both [[Thora Tarkanan]] and [[Marix d'Cannith]] for his own ends.

His relationship with Thora Tarkanan, the House's leader, is complex. She helped lift him from the depths of Sharn's slums and gave him his current position of prominence within the House. However, the Beggar King harbors greater ambitions to one day lead House Tarkanan himself, and Thora is well aware he may attempt to undermine or replace her. She tries to keep him placated on the ruling council while watching him closely for any signs of betrayal.

The Beggar King's deeper motivations stem from a tragic past. As a child he was the victim of horrific dragonmark experiments conducted by a member of [[House Cannith]] seeking to cultivate new marks. This left him both disfigured and traumatized. 

Fueled by rage, his lone objective is to tear once more tear the Tarkanan bloodline to the ground, and every aberrant dragonmark with it.

# Professor Baelen ir'Torn


A notably eccentric figure even within the diverse staff of [[Morgrave University]], Baelen ir'Torn stands out for his intense focus on esoteric magical phenomena. His vast knowledge and intense curiosity are only matched by his stubbornness and quick temper when challenged, traits which have garnered him both respect and dismissal among his colleagues.

Baelen's academic standing has been jeopardized by his unorthodox theories about the [[Day of Mourning]], which he ascribes to a cataclysmic disruption of primal forces. His propositions have been widely dismissed by his peers, and his credibility has suffered greatly as a result. Despite the widespread skepticism, Baelen has not been deterred from his beliefs.

Baelen's most significant possession is a seemingly [[Codex|blank book]] that he asserts is an old research journal of a figure that was directly involved in causing the Day of Mourning. It was left for him by an anonymous source one day. Unbenounced to him, this figure was [[Syvander]], whos actions are guided by the leading threads of the [[Draconic Prophecy]].

The journal's pages reveal their hidden contents when exposed to the energy of dragonshards. Baelen has deciphered a portion of the book using his collection of Eberron shards. However, to complete the decoding, he needs a [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber]] and a [[Dragonshards#^b906e5|Siberys]] shard. Lacking the adventuring skills to procure either, he has turned to the party for assistance.

His hope lies in validating his theories through the remaining content of the journal, clearing his name in academic circles, and more importantly, shedding more light on the calamitous Day of Mourning. Baelen ir'Torn may be eccentric, and his theories may seem outlandish, but his thirst for knowledge and understanding could lead to essential breakthroughs in comprehending the true nature of the Day of Mourning.
