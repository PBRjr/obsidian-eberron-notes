5. Internal Conflict: House Cannith experienced a major split during the Last War when [[Cyre]] was destroyed in the [[Day of Mourning|Mourning]].

Emblem: Griffon
HQ: Vedkyar Enclave, [[Karrnath]]
Race: Halfling

---

House Jorasco is a prominent healing house in the world of Eberron, known for its exceptional skills in the art of healing and restoration. House Jorasco has been providing its services to the people of Khorvaire for centuries.

Thought House Jorasco will provide healing services to all who need it (and all who can afford it), there are rumors that House Jorasco worked with [[House Vadalis]] during the [[Last War]], potentially developing biological weapons.

---

Services Rendered:

While the exact prices for specific treatments may vary, House Jorasco always strives to find a balance between sustaining their operations and fulfilling their mission of providing healing and restoration to all who seek it.

---

### Diamond Conspiracy
Immortality is bad for business. House Jorasco thrives on being the premier source of healing and ressurection, the latter part of which generates them a significant amount of money. Cheap ressurection isn't easy to come by - and House Jorasco leaders make sure it stays that way.

The lowest and most available form of true ressurection is _Revivify_. With access to a large diamond, any common cleric could perform ressurection services, potentially sucking away profits and renown from Jorasco clerics.

Did you know diamonds really aren't that hard to find? In fact, Eberron has a wealth of diamonds in it's cave systems. However, shady contracts, lobbying, and intimidation with governments and land owners has allowed House Jorasco to establish a near monopoly on diamond mining, allowing them to exponentially inflate their price.

This is a secret kept close to the House's chest, and they don't take kindly to purchased from unsanctioned dealers, nor do they enjoy lowly adventurers asking questions.

# Dragonmarked Houses

# House Tarkanan


House Tarkanan is not a true dragonmarked house but rather a criminal organization that has risen to prominence in [[Sharn|Sharn's]] underworld. Composed of individuals who bear aberrant [[dragonmarks]], the house is a haven for those marked by destiny as outcasts and anomalies. Despite their status as pariahs, members of House Tarkanan are bound together by their shared misfortune and a desire for recognition and respect.

Members of House Tarkanan seek acceptance, recognition, and a sense of belonging that society at large denies them due to their aberrant dragonmarks. The alliance with [[Marix d'Cannith]], through which they receive Mourning-infused weaponry, is seen as a step towards gaining the respect and influence they crave.

House Tarkanan also seeks to challenge the established [[Dragonmarked Houses]] and prove that those with aberrant dragonmarks are not mere anomalies, but possess powers that can equal - or even surpass - those of the recognized houses. Through harnessing the power of [[Mourning]], House Tarkanan aims to force the rest of Sharn to acknowledge their might and legitimacy.

---

## Key Members
1. **[[Thora Tarkanan]]:** Thora, the leader of the house, is a stern and charismatic woman bearing a dangerous and unpredictable dragonmark. A skilled tactician, she commands the loyalty of the aberrant marked.

2. **[[Halas Martain]]:** Thora's right-hand man, Halas, is a skilled infiltrator with a unique dragonmark granting him impressive healing abilities. His level-headed nature provides a balancing counterpoint to Thora's fiery spirit.

3. Peter Auburn: A mid level member of the House, Peter operates the [[The Dragon's Breath Tavern]] and also plays a significant role in the trafficing of mourn weapons from Marix to the House.

---

## Headquarters and Outposts:

House Tarkanan operates from a stronghold in Sharn's lower city, an area known as [[Dura]]. They also maintain various safehouses and bases across the city's districts, including in the [[Dragoneyes District]] and the [[Depths]].

They also "own" several different types of establishments throughout the lower districts of Sharn, including the Dragon's Breath Tavern. They are constantly looking to expand their influence, and even have domain over some shops that are not directly owned by them, by way of a "protection" fee. 

---

## Enemies

1. **[[The Boromar Clan]]**: Run by a combination of goblins and bugbears, the Boromar clan is the largest organized criminal organization in Sharn. Established long ago, their influence and power has waxed and wained. After a deal to remain neutral between them and House Tarkanan was broken in a mysterious incident, the two houses have been waging an underground war, each pursuing total control of the [[Sharn underground]].
2. [[The Beggar King]]: An elusive figure said to bear multiple dragonmarks, the Beggar King is a major player within the Sharn underground. His history with experimental dragonmarks has made him a stubborn and powerful enemy of house Tarkanan.
