## Airship Crash
Traveling on a merchant airship for their own reasons, the PCs become involved in a mid-air battle against pirates, which inevitably leads to the ship crashing, with the PCs as some of the very few survivors.

The first session will consist of the airship introduction, battle, and crash. Then they must navigate the wreckage sight, maneuver around or fight the pirates looting the wreckage and torturing the survivors, and find their own way to Sharn. 

Once they arrive they get a good introduction to the City of Towers (papers please) during the festival of Wildnight.

## Airship
The PCs are traveling abord a merchent airship powered by an air elemental contained within a Khyber crystal. Other magitech enhances and controls the power of the elemental to make the ship fly. Destruction or dislodgemenet of this crystal would send the ship crashing to the ground.

The ship embarked from [[Fairhaven]], [[Aundair]], hauling mostly typical supplies and food. Each PC should have their own reason for traveling to Sharn, along with methods to get on board the expensive airship.

In the middle of the night the airship is attacked by Kobold pirates hailing from Drooam.

The airship eventually will crash south of Wroat, on the west side of the Dagger River about 100 miles from Sharn, or 2 days on horse back and between 3 - 5 days on foot, depending on speed. 

On the ship are 4 [[Statblocks#Veteran|Veteran]] guards and 8 [[Statblocks#Commoner|Commoner]] workers. They also have a mounted [[Statblocks#Balista|Balista]].

Crew:
- Jonston Marsh - red Tiefling Captain
- Lick - Halfling First mate

## Pirates
The attack pirates consist of 1 [[Statblocks#Kobold Scale Sorcerer|Kobold Scale Sorcerer]] and 6 [[Statblocks#Pteranodon|Pteranodons]], with 2 [[Statblocks#Kobold|Kobolds]] riding each except for one, which is ridden by the Kobold Scale sorcerer. 

The pirates begin the attack with the sorcerer throwing a schorching ray at the ship, targeting the navigation system and Khyber crystal.  They then drop 2 kobolds off the backs of their mounts onto the deck, which start attacking. Each round a kobold riding a pteranodon will make a fly-by attack. In addition, a new kobold will be dropped off on the deck at the top of each round. 

After several rounds, the rear of the ship gets engulfed in fire, and the ship starts to go down. It drops in the Dagger river, allowing the players to survive relatively unscathed. 

## After the crash
- The crash site is in a forest clearing, with debris and wreckage scattered around. Bodies of crew members and passengers are strewn about.
- There are several kobold warriors scavenging the wreckage for valuables. They are opportunistic and will attack the PCs on sight.
- In the command deck ruins, the PCs find the injured first mate who tells them other survivors fled into the woods chased by kobolds. 
- As the PCs search for survivors, they will encounter kobold search parties (groups of 2d4 kobolds).
- After 2 encounters, they come to a narrowing in the river where they can spot Captain March being beaten by laughing kobolds.
- Across the river is the sorcerer leader and his remaining 2 Pteranodon riders, holding the captain captive and beating him. They don't notice the PCs initially, but if they aren't stopped quickly they will kill the captain.

## Overview


1. The PCs receive a strange brass compass with Giant runes translating to "New beginnings at Giant's end"
2. Over the next few days, the PCs feel glimpses of being watched. Its the [[Lords of Dust]] using scry to watch them.
3. Their quarters in Sharn are ransacked by an unknown assailant ([[Church of the Silver Flame]]) searching for the compass.
4. Zealous Silver Flame agents confront the PCs, demanding they hand over the "dangerous relic" compass to be contained.
5. Research suggests the compass may lead to the ancient Giant kingdom of [[Vaalk'vrah]] in [[Xen'drik]] that collected dangerous artifacts.
6. The compass needle persistently points southward to Xen'drik.
7. After overcoming hazards and ruins, the PCs discover a sealed vault in the Vaalk'vrah ruins.
8. The compass unlocks this ancient vault, but the Church of the Silver Flame makes a final attempt to stop it from opening.
9. Hints that some unseen force manipulated events to have the PCs find and open this vault, unleashing an unknown danger


# Xen'Drik Plot

## Overview


1. **Tensions in the City of Towers are at an all time high.** With [[Dragonmarked Houses]], criminal organizations, and the Sharn government all at each others throats, a city-wide war could erupt with a single wrong move from any involved. Significant reasons for tension:
	- A week ago, [[Saidan Boromar]] began to suffer from an "illness" that kept him bed bound. The [[Boromar clan]] has since been quiet on his whereabouts, however many suspect he is actually dead, and those in the clan are attempting to figure out how to stop the house from crumbling.
	- Daask has recently increased the frequency and boldness of their attacks, sensing the weakness of the Boromars.
2. **The Boromar clan is slipping into dismay**
	- The death of Saidan has lead to the rise of two factions within the clan: Those that support the succession of [[Castar]] - his chief advisor, and those that support [[Halak Boromar]]- his chief enforcement officer. 
3. **The party witnesses the assassination of [[Shassa Tarr]]**
	1. Council Woman Shassa Tarr  played a vital role in keeping the smaller underground organizations from warring with each other. Her death may just be where the immense tension outgrows its precarious perch of peace.
4. [[Loro Cass]] attempts to recruit the party into looking into either [[The Tyrants]] or [[House Tarkanan]] to find out what happened to his daughter. 
	1. See [[The Dragon's Breath Tavern]] or [[The Crimson Silk Brothel]]
	2. [[The Beggar King|The Beggar King's]] spies notice what the PCs are searching for, and are willing to offer information if it aids in the downfall of House Tarkanan.


## Important NPCs
- Boromar Clan
	- **Saidan Boromar**: Former patriarch of the clan, recently missing (deceased)
	- **Castar**: Gnome chief advisor to Saidan, politically and economically intelligent
	- **Halak Boromar**: Boromar's chief enforcement officer, operates fight rings
- **The Beggar King**: Disfigured experiment of aberrant dragonmarks gone wrong, hates House Tarkanan with all his being

## Rumors
- "I know a dancer at the Crimson Silk who saw the Tyrants' boss meeting with Councilor Tarr. Were they in league?"
