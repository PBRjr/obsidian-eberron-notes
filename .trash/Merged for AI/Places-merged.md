## Tarvick's Market


The Bazaar is a sprawling marketplace perched atop of a series of intersecting bridges that connect various towers in middle [[Tarvick's Landing]]. Filled with diverse populations seeking a plethora of goods, this area is notorious for its exotic smells and interesting "people watching" opportunities. 

Being located in Tarvick's Landing, this market caters to a very diverse population, including a large subset of shifters, changelings, and Cyran refugees. The food and culture here reflects that, and most here won't take a second glance at a type of people that they've never seen before.

The Sharn watch has a larger presence here than most other places in the district, though its still small compared to other parts of the city. The [[Sharn Watch]] here is relatively fair and uncorrupt, thanks to the work of [[Iyanna ir'Talan]]. 

## Location

Tarvick's Market is situated in middle Tarvick's Landing, and its host to many different shops. Its main bazaar is situated on a series of intersecting bridges and platforms that form a large market square.

Being situated directly above [[Terminus]] allows for the goods being shipped in from across [[Khorvaire]] via lightning rale to shipped directly to the markets. As a result, several large magical lifts create passage ways from terminus to the upper districts, though they are rarely open to personal use.

Besides common methods of sky travel like [[Soarsleds]], [[Skycoaches]], and exotic mounts, normal methods of travel are possible via suspended buildings and roads and towers that serve only to act as a staircase upwards. These locations are commonly clogged with heavy foot traffic, though.

## Goods & Shops
Plenty of various goods flow through this marketplace, from high priced jewelry and magical items to simple food and supplies.  A large majority of farmers choose to set up their shops here, since the Bazaar of Dura is very dangerous and the North Market is expensive.

Some, but not most expensive magical items and other wares can be found here, though for the pricier items one may have to travel to somewhere like North Market.

## Plot Hooks
1. **Kobold Daask Attack**: A group of creature-riding kobolds from the monster-run criminal organization [[Daask]] shows up from the sky and attempts to rob the patrons of the bustling street market!

## Dragoneyes District


The Dragoneyes District is located on the western side of [[Sharn]], in the lower levels of [[Tavick's Landing]]. It is notorious for its large population of immigrants from the continent of Xen'drik, primarily Drow, Shifters, and Golieths. The district also houses a significant number of shifters, goblins, and changelings. The architecture here is diverse and exotic, reflecting the various cultures that have found a home in this part of the city.

---

2. [[Dragon Towers]]: These are a series of tall structures that give the district its name. At night, they are lit up with magical flames that cast a dragon-shaped shadow over Dragoneyes.

3. [[Blackstone Church]]: This old church stands out as one of the few bastions of order in Dragoneyes. It is run by [[Brother Garrow]], a half-orc cleric who offers sanctuary to those seeking refuge from the chaos outside.

4. [[Tarvick's Market]]: A sprawling market where all sorts of exotic goods can be found - treasures from Xen'drik, rare ingredients for spells, unique weapons forged by goliath blacksmiths or even outlawed substances smuggled into Sharn.

5. [[Khyber's Gate]]: A dangerous neighborhood known for its connections to the criminal underworld and its proximity to Khyber's Gate - an entrance into the vast network of caverns beneath Sharn known as the Depths.

6. Guards: The City Watch has little presence in Dragoneyes due to its reputation as a lawless area governed by organized crime syndicates like Daask or Tyrants. 

7. Crime Syndicates: Many criminal groups operate in this district such as Daask - an organization run by monstrous races like goblins and ogres; House Tarkanan - thieves and assassins bearing aberrant dragonmarks; and Tyrants - changeling-led group specializing in information brokering.

8. Entertainment Venues: Famous spots include Thirteen Wands (a magical cabaret), Spider's Nest (a fight club where drow ex-gladiators perform), or Elaydrenâ€™s Fortune (a high stakes gambling house).

Remember that despite their love for revelry and freedom, residents value their privacy highly and may not respond well to outsiders prying into their business.

## Blackstone Church


## General Information

Its sturdy construction is a testament to an era gone by, providing shelter to those in need. Its towering spires can be seen from a distance, and its heavy doors promise protection from the chaotic streets.

**History**: Having been founded before the collapse of Old Sharn, the church is one of the oldest standing structures that remains in the City of Towers. This is a testament to the strength and wisdom needed to be a priest of this church. It is a rare and very highly respected position. Even organized criminal organizations tend to respect the boundary of the massive wooden doors.

**Leader - Brother Garrow**: A half-orc cleric of strong conviction, Brother Garrow leads the Blackstone Church with a mixture of stern discipline and compassionate wisdom. His past may be marred with violence in defense of this ancient monestary, but his present is dedicated to peace and sanctuary. Garrow's guidance is sought by many within the area, and he has become a beacon of stability in an otherwise turbulent district.

**Religious Practices**: The Blackstone Church worships the [[Church of the Silver Flame]], however they welcome all that wish to attend. Since the Silver Flame practices an ideology rather than worshipping a particular god, they do not push away the worship of other deities. Pilgrims and locals alike are welcome to attend, and many find solace in the safe amd structured environment.

**Community and Services**: The church provides more than just spiritual guidance. It serves as a shelter for those in need, providing food, warmth, and safety. Many destitute and desperate individuals find refuge within its walls, and the clergy works tirelessly to aid those who have lost their way.

**Relationship with Dragoneyes**: Being a bastion of order in Dragoneyes is no small feat. The church's principles often clash with the lawless nature of the district, making it a target for various criminal elements. However, the respect Brother Garrow commands, along with the church's long-standing presence, has created a delicate balance. Many organized crime factions in Dragoneyes recognize the value of the sanctuary it provides, allowing it to exist within this tumultuous region.

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Unseen Threat**: There have been reports of strange, unseen forces causing mischief within the walls of Blackstone Church, disrupting services and scaring worshippers. Brother Garrow believes it's a malevolent spirit and asks for help in exorcising it.

3. **Protection from Gangs**: A local gang has started harassing people seeking refuge at the Blackstone Church. The players might witness Brother Garrow attempting to pay these thugs to leave the church and its people unharmed, so that he may avoid more violence.

4. **The False Prophet**: A charismatic stranger has started preaching blasphemy outside the church, drawing away believers and stirring up trouble with his radical teachings of [[The Travelor]].

5. **The Secret Passage**: During renovations, a hidden passage is discovered beneath the church leading into an unknown part of Sharn's undercity. 

6. **Brother Garrow's Past**: Someone from Brother Garrow's violent past reappears threatening to reveal secrets that could ruin his reputation and destabilize his position within the church unless he pays a hefty sum of gold. He may be looking for ways to make this person go away.
   
7. **Rituals Gone Wrong**: During a routine ritual at Blackstone Church, something goes horribly wrong causing strange phenomena or summoning an evil creature.
   
8. **Silver Flame Pilgrimage**: Once every decade, members of Blackstone Church embark on a dangerous pilgrimage to renew their faith in Silver Flame at a distant shrine located in treacherous terrain filled with hostile creatures. Brother Garrow is keeping an eye out for a devotee to take care of the church while he is away.
  
9. **Cursed Donation**: A wealthy but shady benefactor donates a large sum of money for charity work but soon after terrible luck starts plaguing Blackstone Church; accidents happen, people fall ill and there is general unease among devotees suspecting that the donation might have been cursed.

## Sharn


## Overview

Sharn, also known as the "City of Towers," is a thriving metropolis located in the southeast of Khorvaire. It is the largest city in the continent and is known for its magical towers that reach high into the sky, earning its nickname. Sharn is an eclectic city, brimming with different races, cultures, and factions.

## Districts

### Central Plateau
The Central Plateau is the heart of Sharn, housing the city's major political, financial and educational institutions. The district is distinguished by its grand architecture and towering skyscrapers, reflecting the city's magical and technological advancements. It is also home to many of Sharn's elite, with upscale residences and luxurious amenities.

#### Lower Central Plateau
The Lower Central Plateau is filled with markets, shops, taverns, and working-class residences. It's often bustling with activity day or night.

### The Cogs
Located below the city proper, The Cogs are a network of massive tunnels filled with factories and forges. This district houses much of Sharn's industry as well as its poorest citizens.

### Menthis Plateau
An entertainment hub boasting theaters, restaurants, casinos, and sports arenas. The famous Torchfire theatre can be found here.

### Dura
One of the oldest districts in Sharn, Dura is a rough and tumble area home to working-class citizens, immigrants, and a fair share of shady characters. The district is divided into Upper, Middle and Lower Dura.

#### Upper Dura
Upper Dura is home to middle-class citizens and is one of the more stable areas in Dura. It houses a number of schools, small businesses, and residential buildings. Notable locations include Daggerwatch Garrison and Stronghold Park.

#### Middle Dura
Middle Dura is filled with hardworking lower-class citizens, many of whom work in the nearby factories or docks. It's often bustling with activity day or night, with various taverns and markets scattered throughout.

#### Lower Dura
Lower Dura is known for its rough reputation. Rife with crime and poverty, it's home to a large portion of Sharn's underclass. Despite this, it also has a strong sense of community among its residents. The Bazaar district in Lower Dura is well-known for its affordable goods.

### Cliffside
Located on the steep cliffs that edge the city to the south, Cliffside offers breathtaking views but precarious living conditions. Filled with sailors, dockworkers, and those drawn by the allure of adventure or escape from law enforcement.

### Tarvickâ€™s Landing
A major transport hub filled with rail stations, airship docks and warehouses. This district keeps Sharn connected with other parts of Khorvaire both by land and air. Home to a diverse mix of inhabitants from traveling merchants to dock workers.

### The Depths
Below even The Cogs lies The Depths - a place shrouded in mystery & danger that few venture into willingly. Home to ancient ruins & creatures best left undisturbed; this area serves as a reminder of what lies beneath Sharnâ€™s grandeur.

## Points of Interest

### Morgrave University
Founded by Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave, itâ€™s known for its extensive collection of relics and artifacts from all over Eberron.

### Torchfire Theatre 
Home to world-renowned playwrights and actors. Itâ€™s a symbol of culture in Sharn where people flock to witness grand performances.

### Citadel Tower 
Headquarters of Sharnâ€™s Watch and base for the city guard. Itâ€™s one of the most secured locations in the city.

## Society & Culture

Sharn is a melting pot where cultures from across Eberron mingle. Its residents include humans, elves, dwarves, changelings, warforged - even members of more exotic races like goblins or tieflings can be found here. This diversity is reflected in every aspect of life in Sharn from its cuisine to its architecture.

Despite this diversity though, social inequality runs deep in Sharn with a clear divide between those who live in its soaring towers versus those who dwell beneath them in The Cogs or The Depths. This tension frequently leads to conflicts but also fuels much of the city's vibrant art scene as well as its ceaseless political intrigue.

## Travel
### Travel Time
Travel in Sharn can be unpredictable. Residents joke that it takes about an hour to get anywhere, whether itâ€™s just down three levels in the same tower or all the way across town. Of course, skycoaches reduce the time dramatically compared to walking from place to place, and characters who really know their way around (as well as characters who are willing to ask for directions frequently along the way) can get to their destinations more quickly than newcomers who refuse to display their ignorance. 

If it becomes important to know how long it takes to get from one place to another, use the following rules of thumb:

|Mode of Travel and Destination|Travel Time*|
|---|---|
|Foot Travel||
|Destination in same district|3d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|6d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|3d6 Ã— 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|6d6 Ã— 5 minutes|
|Flying Travel||
|Destination in same district|1d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|2d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|1d6 Ã— 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|2d6 Ã— 5 minutes|

- A party can reduce this time by one-half if one character makes a successful DC 15 Knowledge (local) or Gather Information check

- Numbers in parentheses are for magebred horses with the swift breed special quality

## NPCs
- Jira Calderon, Changling owner and madame posing as a half-elf woman.

## Hooks / Encounters
Here are some ways the DM could drop clues to steer the PCs towards gathering information about the gang wars at the Crimson Silk:

- When first arriving, the PCs overhear courtesans gossiping about a recent "dust-up" between clients affiliated with different factions.

- Noticing the PCs, a server "accidentally" spills a drink and mutters quick apologies, also slipping them a rolled up napkin with a message scrawled inside.

- If the PCs get into a bar fight, some thugs bear tattoos signifying they belong to one of the warring factions. Could be interrogated later for info.

- A secret door left slightly ajar reveals a room with documents strewn about detailing investigations into who has been assassinating higher-ups. No conclusive leads have been drawn.

- Strange noises lead the PCs to find a damp cellar room with shackles on the walls and the personal effects of someone important from a rival gang.

- A Tyrant guard pays special attention to the PCs, implying he knows they're looking for information and offers to broker a meeting with someone who can help, for the right price. 

- Madame Calderon herself sends the PCs a request to privately discuss business with someone new in town looking to make inroads with the Tyrants.
