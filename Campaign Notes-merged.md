Race: Halfling

---

Thought House Jorasco will provide healing services to all who need it (and all who can afford it), there are rumors that House Jorasco worked with [[House Vadalis]] during the [[Last War]], potentially developing biological weapons.

While the exact prices for specific treatments may vary, House Jorasco always strives to find a balance between sustaining their operations and fulfilling their mission of providing healing and restoration to all who seek it.

---

### Diamond Conspiracy
Immortality is bad for business. House Jorasco thrives on being the premier source of healing and ressurection, the latter part of which generates them a significant amount of money. Cheap ressurection isn't easy to come by - and House Jorasco leaders make sure it stays that way.

The lowest and most available form of true ressurection is _Revivify_. With access to a large diamond, any common cleric could perform ressurection services, potentially sucking away profits and renown from Jorasco clerics.

Did you know diamonds really aren't that hard to find? In fact, Eberron has a wealth of diamonds in it's cave systems. However, shady contracts, lobbying, and intimidation with governments and land owners has allowed House Jorasco to establish a near monopoly on diamond mining, allowing them to exponentially inflate their price.

This is a secret kept close to the House's chest, and they don't take kindly to purchased from unsanctioned dealers, nor do they enjoy lowly adventurers asking questions.

Multiple shipments from the Mournland were tracked to Marix's facilities via lightning rale. Contents unknown, but believed to be related to Mourning weapons. Security is high.

An operative managed to infiltrate the premises but was discovered before gathering substantial information. Operative's last message mentioned something to do with "Captured Essence."

Further investigation is underway but has proven highly risky.

End of report.


## Incriminating Documents
To whom it may concern,

After careful consideration of the recent events and the opportunities they present, I have decided to move forward with the Mourn weapon production. Our connections within House Tarkanan shall remain discreet, and I assure you that our transactions will be conducted with the utmost secrecy.

The newly produced prototypes have proven quite functional. I am convinced that our collaboration will not only be profitable but also lead to significant advancements in arcane weaponry.

Best regards,

Marix d'Cannith


## Dragon Blood


> "Dragon's Blood is a magical phenomenon unlike any other. It enables the user to tap into a crude, unstable form of the primal forces of magic. But like handling raw elemental forces, the risks far outweigh the fleeting benefits. This drug not only wreaks havoc on the user's physical form but also destabilizes the very magical essence of their being. The uncontrolled magical outbursts are akin to trying to direct a thunderstorm with a tin roof - unpredictable, chaotic, and more often than not, disastrous."
<span class="right-align">-Illicit Magical Substance (IMS) researcher, Morgrave University</span>
---

Dragon Blood, also known as Blood or Heat, is an illegal substance commonly found in the lower levels of [[Sharn]]. In its raw form, it is a thick, iridescent liquid that shifts color in the light, reminiscent of an oil slick or a soap bubble. It is typically consumed by dropping the liquid onto the tongue, where it absorbs quickly into the bloodstream, causing an immediate and potent effect.

Users often describe the initial effects as a sensation of warmth spreading throughout the body, a quickening of the senses, and an unexplainable feeling of being deeply connected to the mystical weave of magic that permeates the world. Regular users become addicted, not just to the drug's effects but also to the feeling of power and the illusions of insight into the magical world around them.

However, the drug's long-term effects can be devastating. Prolonged use of Dragon's Blood results in physical deterioration and mental instability, as the body struggles to cope with the sudden influx of magical energy. It can lead to hallucinations, erratic behavior, and in the worst cases, wild magical outbursts.

---

The following is a table of random magical effects Dragon's Blood might trigger. The effects of each last for 1 minute, or 10 rounds, unless specified otherwise. 

1. The user emits a bright light in a 30-foot radius.
2. The next spell cast by the user targets a random creature within range, but does not use a spell slot. If the spell has an AOE, it is cast centered on a random creature in range.
3. The user vomits relentlessly, losing their next turn and gaining 1 point of exhaustion.
4. The user can only speak in haiku.
5. The user becomes enlarged, but gains a level of exhaustion once the effect wears off.
6. The user is under the effect of the invisibility spell for the duration.
7. The user gains a flying speed equal to their walking speed. If the user already has a flying speed, it doubles.
8. The user immediately casts Fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on themselves.
9. For the next minute, all the user's melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage, both to the target and the user.
10. The user is affected as if by the Polymorph spell, transformed into a sheep for the duration.

## Dragonshards


Dragonshards are fragments of the bodies of the progenitor dragons, and each type is associated with one of the dragons. These mystical stones have the ability to hold and channel magical energy, making them an integral part of many magical items and spells. They come in three types: Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron shards, each with unique characteristics and applications.

---

**Eberron Dragonshards**
Eberron shards, also known as "dragon's blood" (not to be confused with [[Dragon Blood]]) or bloodstones, are the most common type. They are typically found in rock formations or riverbeds across the world of Eberron. This shard's radiant, multicolored veins stand in stark contrast to its otherwise transparent exterior. Eberron shards are used to bind elemental creatures and power the mighty airships and lightning rails. They also play a vital role in the creation and operation of the Warforged and sentient constructs. ^90b643

---

**Siberys Dragonshards**
Siberys shards, or "dragon's tears", are the rarest and most coveted of the three. They are not found in the ground but instead fall from the Ring of Siberys that encircles the world. These shards are golden and exhibit a radiant glow. They are predominantly used for the creation of dragonmarks and serve as key components in the highest echelons of artifice. The Siberys shards are coveted by those with dragonmarks, as they can augment and enhance their powers. ^b906e5

---

**Khyber Dragonshards**
Khyber shards, known as "dragon's teeth", are found deep within the world, in the underdark and other subterranean locales. These shards have a sinister, dark hue, often perceived as an abyssal black or a deep blue. Khyber shards are used to create binding circles and magic items that contain or utilize fiends or other extraplanar entities. Their energy is considered potent but unpredictable, which often leads to their use in more nefarious magical applications. ^023b44

### Description

- A shattered [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber Dragonshard]] the size of a fist, covered in ancient draconic runes with a faint glow pulsing from within
- The gem is warm to the touch and has a gentle pulsing vibration.
- It has 4 visible chunks taken out of it, which clearly bore additional runes that are now missing.

### History

- As a part of the ancient ritual involving the sacrifice of the Couatl, Rak Tulkesh's avatar was separated from his demi planes, exposing a vulnerability. 
- Beaten by a force of ancient dragons, consciousness was sealed away in this Dragonshard.
- To keep it out of the hands of the [[Lords of Dust]], it was shattered, its fragments spread across the world.

### Powers/Abilities

- The Dragonshard contains the fragmented power of Rak Tulkesh.
- These shards are the sources of power [[Woe]] is seeking.
- They can be combined with a soul through a ritual, giving the user power, but also corrupting them.
- Once they are all combined again, the user's soul will be consumed as fuel to release Rak Tulkesh's avatar from its bonds.
- Can only be properly wielded by one that is *tainted*
	- One is tainted when they are born or die while in immediate proximity to the shard or its fragments
### Location

- The main gem is [[Woe#Abilities & Powers|Woe's phylactery]]
	- Lick: 1 Shard before airship crash
	- [[Professor Baelen ir'Torn]]: 1 Shard
	- 2 remaining shards: unknown

### Interacting With It

- Touching a shard gives the wielder a sense of unimaginable power that has been splintered and broken, as if the vastness of it is unreachable, just beyond the horizon.
- The shard can not be destroyed while a part of Rak Tulkesh's power remains within. It can only be fractured and contained.

### Hook
- The Silver Flame is constantly searching for it, even ransacking the Players quarters if they find out about it.
- [[Woe]] seeks to increase his power using the shards
- [[Mordakesh]] seeks to consume Woe's soul with the completed Dragonshard and unleash his master.

## Jonston's Note


This piece of worn parchment has obviously seen the wear-and-tear of an active lifestyle. If Jon was killed it also has some blood smears on it.

> Dear Jonny,
> 
> I miss you so much since you left [[Shavalant]]. The house feels empty without your laughter filling it up. I hope you are doing okay on your travels. 
> 
> Things have been odd around here lately. The animals have been riled up, especially at night. Folks say they hear weird noises coming from the Whitehorn Woods. I'm sure it's nothing to worry over, but it would be nice to have you home. 
> 
> I'm going to bake your favorite blueberry pie for when you visit. I can't wait to see your smiling face and hear about your adventures. Please be careful and come back soon. You're always in my prayers.

# Lore

## Day of Mourning


The age of demons exposed the world to the power of the Overlords. Great, terrifying, and nearly unstoppable, a single overlord freed of its bonds can assert its domain across an entire country. 

The [[Dragons of Argonnessen]], combined with the full force of the [[Couatl]], waged a war against the [[Overlords]]. Weaving the threads of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], the Couatl sacrificed their collective life force to form the Silver Flame, forever imprisoning the Overlords by separating their consciousness from the power of their Heart Demi planes.

Though they can be imprisoned, the Overlords can never be defeated. In modern times, with the Last War's destruction threatening to plunge the entirety of Khorvaire into chaos, the [[Lords of Dust]] threaten to use the prophecy to break their lords bonds.

After learning the location of the Silver Flame, [[Varak the Rageblight]] led demonic forces into the depths of its containment. Armed with the misleading power granted to him by the [[Steelhardt]], Vorak attacked the Silver Flame. It defended itself by releasing a portion of its power, causing the Mourning. The protection mechanisms of the Steelhardt within Vorak broke under the awesome power of the Flame's retaliation, corrupting Vorak into a rage-fueled killer, cursed to Lich-dom.

## Draconic Prophecy


> The falling of a tree, the flap of a butterflies wings, the whispers of wind in man's ear. It is not known what drove the universe to create such an eternal living document. That's what unique about chaos - sometimes, things just happen. 
<span class="right-align">-Professor Baelen ir'Torn</span>
---
## Functionality
The prophecy isn't a document that tells of all that will be. Its more like an observation of specific circumstances that give a series of if-then statements in regard to the universe. Only an ancient or powerful being may have the knowledge to interpret these signs into any useful knowledge.

- [[The Chamber]] actively works to use the prophecy to engineer favorable results in the world.
- The [[Lords of Dust]] actively work to use the prophecy to free their [[Overlords]].

## In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology
In the intricate tapestry of Eberron's planes, the societal structures of fiends, especially those from the plane of Fernia, the Sea of Fire, exhibit a complexity rivaling that of the most convoluted mortal civilizations. Each fiend, from the minor rakshasas roaming the material plane to the formidable overlords shackled in Khyber, occupies a distinct niche within their fiery domain. This hierarchy, while seemingly rigid, is propelled by a constant undercurrent of ambition and subterfuge, as each entity vies for power, influence, and the opportunity to extend their reach beyond their infernal confines.

Central to the social dynamics of Fernia's denizens is the manipulation of mortal desires and fears through pacts and bargains. These agreements, etched in the essence of the plane itself, are not mere exchanges but pivotal events that can alter the fate of realms. Fiends, with their unparalleled cunning, craft these pacts to ensnare the unwary, trading momentary boons for eternal servitude or influence. Such transactions underscore the fiends' understanding of value, power, and the lengths to which they will go to achieve their ends. Through the lens of these interactions, "In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology" sheds light on the intricate dance of dominance and dependence that defines the existence of Eberron's most malevolent beings.

### Historic Treaty of Thronehold Ushers In New Era of Peace


The Treaty of Thronehold, a significant document promising to redefine the landscape of Khorvaire, has been signed. This landmark agreement signals the end of the Last War that has plagued our continent for over a century.

The signing ceremony took place in Thronehold Castle, the former seat of Galifar's power. Representatives from each of the twelve recognized nations set aside their bitterness and assembled to formally declare an end to hostilities. 

The Treaty delineates boundaries and acknowledges sovereignty, granting each nation its rightfully earned autonomy. These nations include Aundair, Breland, Cyre - now mournfully referred to as The Mournland - Darguun, Droaam, The Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, The Lhazaar Principalities, The Mror Holds, Q'Barra, The Talenta Plains and Thrane.

The agreement also declares that House Cannith will dismantle Creation Forges across Khorvaire and cease Warforged production henceforth. This clause aims to prevent any future escalation of conflict by stemming the creation of magically manufactured soldiers.

Furthermore, it recognizes Warforged as sentient beings with rights equal to those enjoyed by other denizens of Khorvaire. This groundbreaking recognition marks a progressive step in our continent's history.

However, the treaty leaves several contentious issues unresolved. Notably absent are provisions addressing war reparations or specific terms for demilitarization. Additionally, several regions and factions remain unrecognized by the Treaty; this includes Shadow Marches and Valenar who argue for their sovereignty.

While critics express concerns over these omissions potentially sowing seeds for future conflicts; optimists view this as an opportunity for continuing diplomatic negotiations in a newfound atmosphere of peace.

The Treaty signifies not only an end but also a new beginning – a chance for our war-torn continent to heal its wounds and move towards unity and prosperity. It is indeed a monumental milestone in Khorvaire’s history which we should all cherish cautiously while working towards establishing lasting peace.


### Skyway's Floating Gardens Flourish with Rare Flora


In a delightful spectacle of nature's resilience, Skyway's floating gardens have become home to a rare species of luminescent flowers, previously thought to be native only to the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. The flowers, known as Starlight Blossoms, have begun to bloom in the high towers of [[Sharn]], casting an enchanting glow over the city's skyline.

The sudden appearance of these flowers has sparked mild curiosity among the citizens and a few scholarly debates in [[Morgrave University|Morgrave University's]] hallowed halls. Botanists are intrigued by how these flowers, typically found in the mystical groves of the Eldeen Reaches, have adapted to the urban environment of Sharn.

In the political landscape, this event has been largely met with passive interest. Some members of the [[Aurum]] have taken to decorating their estates with these glowing blossoms, viewing them as a status symbol. Meanwhile, [[House Vadalis]], bearers of the Mark of Handling and known for their expertise in flora and fauna, have expressed a desire to study these flowers further.

While the Starlight Blossoms' arrival is a minor event in the grand scheme of Sharn's bustling life, it serves as a gentle reminder of the world's enduring magic and mystery. As the city continues its daily hustle and bustle, the Starlight Blossoms glow quietly, adding a touch of serene beauty to the City of Towers.

### Concept

Woe is a decommissioned warforged soldier who served with distinction in the Last War. After the Treaty of Thronehold left him without purpose, he willingly underwent a profane ritual by Mordakesh to replace his heart with a Khyber dragonshard fragment, granting him sinister powers as a [[Woe#Abilities & Powers|Warlock Lich]].  

### Description 

- Appearance: A bulky, 7 ft tall warforged with numerous battle scars. His eyes glow an ominous purple. The hollow cavity in his chest flickers with a faint violet light.     ![[Woe portrait.png|right|230]]

- Personality: Driven by a sense of purpose and duty, but his methods are merciless. Has disdain for the "weakness" of living creatures.  

- Mannerisms: Speaks in a commanding, metallic voice, with a prose that is strong but short and to-rhe-point. Carries out orders swiftly and efficiently. Never wastes movements in combat.

### Backstory

Woe was an elite warforged soldier constructed centuries ago by House Cannith. He was unwaveringly loyal and skilled in warfare. One day in the midst of battle, Woe was struck down and killed by a halfling known as *Dandal*.

Dandal had been carrying a "lucky" family heirloom - a small fragment of a larger [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] - which attached a dark cancer upon Woe's soul as he died. 

Woe awoke, months later, in the laboratories of [[Mordakhesh]], having been revived and put back together, piece-by-piece.

Mordakesh promised him a new reason for being - serving the overlord Rak Tulkesh. Woe agreed to undergo a profane ritual that fused a Khyber dragonshard fragment containing a sliver of the overlord's essence into his metallic body, awakening sinister powers.

### Motivations

- Regain the sense of purpose he felt during the Last War
- Give all warforged the new purpose he has now found, serving a greater power.
- Hunt down fractured Khyber dragonshards to increase his power

### Foreboding Premonitions
**Disturbed Dreams:** Players experience vivid nightmares where they're battling an overwhelming purple darkness, or Woe himself, only to wake up with a sense of dread. These dreams could occasionally provide cryptic clues or warnings about Woe's plans, wrapped in metaphorical imagery related to Woe's backstory or abilities.

**Purple Lightning:** Before a significant encounter or event linked to Woe, the sky could be lit by rare and unnatural purple lightning, even without a storm. This phenomenon, witnessed by the players or recounted by locals, serves as an omen of Woe's direct involvement or the presence of his power.

**Reflections in Water:** On occasion, when the players look into still water, their reflections could momentarily shift to show them as lifeless, puppet-like versions of themselves, with glowing purple eyes. This unsettling vision fades quickly but leaves an eerie feeling of being marked by Woe.

### Abilities & Powers

- Granted Warlock-like abilities from his patron [[Rak Tulkesh]].
- His phylactery is the [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber shard]] resting in the center of his chest.
- The shard contains both a small sliver of Rak Tulkesh's power and part of Woe's soul.
- The dragonshard is indestructible, due to the power contained within.
	- If Woe is killed, his soul will remain in the shard until it can take over the body of another creature
	- As Woe gathers more [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] fragments, Rak Tulkesh's influence over Woe will grow until he is completely under the Overlord's control.

### Connections & Hooks

- Attacked the PCs' airship to capture a dragonshard fragment!
- Carries out violent raids to obtain shards scattered across Khorvaire.
- Seeking to use resources of other factions to find the remaining shattered khyber dragonshards

## Travel
### Travel Time
Travel in Sharn can be unpredictable. Residents joke that it takes about an hour to get anywhere, whether it’s just down three levels in the same tower or all the way across town. Of course, skycoaches reduce the time dramatically compared to walking from place to place, and characters who really know their way around (as well as characters who are willing to ask for directions frequently along the way) can get to their destinations more quickly than newcomers who refuse to display their ignorance. 

If it becomes important to know how long it takes to get from one place to another, use the following rules of thumb:

|Mode of Travel and Destination|Travel Time*|
|---|---|
|Foot Travel||
|Destination in same district|3d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|6d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|3d6 × 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|6d6 × 5 minutes|
|Flying Travel||
|Destination in same district|1d6 minutes|
|Destination in same ward|2d6 minutes|
|Destination in adjacent ward|1d6 × 5 minutes|
|Destination farther than adjacent ward|2d6 × 5 minutes|

- A party can reduce this time by one-half if one character makes a successful DC 15 Knowledge (local) or Gather Information check

- Numbers in parentheses are for magebred horses with the swift breed special quality

As you approach, you notice the rhythmic clinking of tools and the soft murmur of voices emanating from small shops and houses clustered together. A few houses are blackened and charred, and seemed to have partially collapsed. The buildings themselves are worn but well-kept, surrounded by fields of crops, some of which are parsley scattered with workers. The air carries the earthy scent of tilled soil and fresh produce.

### Mournland





## Underdark

### The Temple of the Endless Rage


# Concept (pg. 143)
- Over 100,000 years ago, at the end of the age of demons, the Couatl made their sacrifice and separated the [[Overlords]]' source of power from the material plane, weakening and trapping their avatars in magical prisons around the world. 
- This is the prison of **[[Rak Tulkesh|Rak Tulkesh's]]** power, which is useless without an avatar.

# Description
> As you step past the stone columns that mark the entrance, the world behind you fades away, replaced by a hushed reverence for something incomprehensibly ancient. The air here is warm, and as it feels like pine needles as it rushes past you. It smells of wet stone and dank moss. 

>  A bright, silver fire emanates from a pulsing purple gem, illuminating the temple from the far side of you, casting you in dim light. Thick columns of cracked marble line this place in multiple rows, acting as supports that hold up the vaulted ceiling. Many runes have been chiseled out of the columns, but the wear of time has made them almost completely unreadable. All you can make out is "Temple - Endless - Rage".

> Rows of well kept wooden pews line both sides of a walkway that leads to the flame. As you take in the vastness of this temple, its centerpiece demands your attention. An enormous pit sits 15ft in front of you. Its depth so vast and dark it swallows any light that dare enter it.

> It has a sort of alluring pull to it that gets stronger the closer you get. Almost as if its calling to you, reaching out to your very soul with a single word... "CLOSER".

# Notable Locations
- The Endless: The pit that sits in the middle of this timeless temple is actually the largest entrance to *Shavarath*, the demiplane of **Rak Tulkesh**. Though its not large enough to allow the return of his Avatar, it still exudes an immensely powerful influence over the land nearby.

# Story

## All Arcs


## Arc Setup
Story arcs are set up in a very specific way that is shown below. The idea is that at least one of these arcs is being moved forward every session. This is combined with a more extensive plot web to create a  cohesive and intuitive narrative experience for the players.

If a list under an Arc is numbered, this represents the order of priority, not necessarily the order it will be completed. The plot points towards the top of each list are more significant, while the ones towards the bottom may be less significant to the main plot, and more prone to being changed or discarded.

Each arc has a "completion point" which indicates when that arc will be wrapped up and the next one will begin.

Arcs do not have to be completed in any particular order, and many immediate arcs may be completed before a narrative arc is completed (or even before it becomes the main focus).

##### Immediate Arc
- This is what the players are attempting to accomplish at this moment or in the immediate future.
- Each is generally wrapped up within a few sessions
- Generally can be extrapolated from sub-plots of narrative arcs
- Thought of in terms of short-term, obvious, and achievable goals, like episodes of a TV show
	- Ex.: *Obtain horses to improve travel on the long roads ahead*
	- Ex. 2: *Assist an apothecary that you encountered on your journey*

##### Narrative Arc
- This is what the collective immediate arcs are building towards
- Each is generally wrapped up with their own satisfying and self-contained storylines
- Thought of in terms of seasons of a TV show. Goals are more long-term and may not be immediately obvious to PCs
	- Ex.: *Safely travel around the nation and make it to the City of Towers*
	- Ex. 2: *Figure out why tensions are high in Sharn and fix it.*

##### Campaign Arc
- The overall theme or main arc of the entire campaign
- Built up to by each narrative arc, becoming more obvious as the game goes on
- Completion of this arc marks the end of the campaign
- Should provide a satisfying ending that involves the culmination of everything the PCs have accomplished so far
	- Ex.: *The final fight with the ultimate BBEG*


## TYFYS Arcs
### Current
#### Immediate
- Continue moving towards Sharn
- Encounter the town of [[Shavalant]]
	- Potential sidequests: [[Whitehorn Wood]] [[Boromar Gang Members]]
- **Completion Point:** The party wraps up their business in Shavalant and continues on their journey
#### Narrative
##### Act 1:
- Encapsulates the party's journey to Sharn through the wilderness and their discovery of the overarching plots/villains
- **Completion point:** The party makes it to [[Sharn]] or decides they have a different, more important objective.





## Encounters

### Arrival at Sharn


**Via lightning rail at Terminus Station.**
As you step off the lightning rail coach, the cacophony of Terminus Station washes over you. The air hums with the energy of a thousand voices, all clamoring, bartering, and calling out greetings or farewells. The station itself is a colossal structure, its high, vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns of dark, polished wood. Enormous everbright lanterns hang from the ceiling, bathing the station in a warm, welcoming glow.

Before you can even take a breath, you're surrounded by a swarm of people. Porters push their way through the throng, their carts piled high with luggage and crates. Skycoach drivers tout the speed and comfort of their vehicles, hoping to lure travelers to their flying chariots. Guides, their faces eager and hopeful, offer their services to help navigate the labyrinthine city. And of course, there are the inevitable beggars, their pleas for alms blending into the general din.

Through the crowd, you can see the many shops and stalls that line the edges of the station. House Orien maintains a strong presence here, with offices for arranging transport and shipping, as well as a small enclave for its heirs. House Sivis has a message station here, and House Deneith has a small outpost where you can hire bodyguards or laborers. House Vadalis even operates a large stable and hostelry, should you need to secure your mounts while exploring the city.

**Via land road at Wroann's Gate.**
As you approach the colossal entrance to the City of Towers, you begin to understand the depth of its name. A breathtaking panorama of soaring spires and towering structures stretches before you, reaching up into the sky as if to pierce the heavens themselves. The sheer scale of the city is overwhelming, and you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.

The gate itself is a marvel of engineering, a massive archway carved from black granite and topped by a titanic statue of Queen Wroann of Breland. The queen holds a scepter in one hand and a sword above her head.

The streets of Wroann's Gate teem with life. Merchants and traders hawk their wares, their voices blending into a cacophony of sound. Travelers from across Khorvaire mingle with the city's residents, their faces reflecting a myriad of cultures and backgrounds. Skycoaches flit through the air like giant dragonflies, carrying passengers to their destinations. And beneath it all, you can hear the constant hum of the Cogs, the beating heart of Sharn's industry.

Crossing the threshold into the impossibly tall city, the first thing that hits you is the smell. It's a complex, ever-shifting blend of a thousand different scents: the tang of smoke and sulfur from the Cogs, the sweet aroma of exotic spices, the stench of sewage and garbage, and the faint but unmistakable fragrance of magic.

The next thing you notice is the noise. Sharn is a city that never sleeps, and the din of its inhabitants is constant. You hear the shouts of merchants hawking their wares, the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the rhythmic clang of hammers in the Cogs, and the distant roar of the crowds in the entertainment districts. It's a noise that can be overwhelming at first, but it's also a noise that pulsates with life and energy.

You're struck by the diversity of the city's inhabitants. Humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and even more exotic creatures all rub shoulders in the crowded streets. You see merchants from the Lhazaar Principalities haggling with traders from the Mror Holds. You see warforged laborers hauling goods alongside halfling teamsters. You see goblin families begging for alms, their faces etched with the hardship of life in the lower wards.

### Reading of Fate

Bjorn's reading
>  Ahh, the Bearwolf. The storm within you rages, your heart torn between duty and blood. Yes, I feel your fury, one that is matched only by the darkness that taints your brother's soul. And in the tidal forces of your anger lies a riptide of betrayal, confusion, and... grief. In time, he will know your pain, and your anger will be his fuel, for your destiny was forged in flame and storm long ago.

Draven's reading:
> A knight of many names, and yet you've barely begun to rediscover what any of them mean to you. The Knight's own mind betrays him, a Valiant sacrifice your curse and your savior. Your mind is shrouded in mist, your memories hidden to you. Its barely perceivable, but you know something is very wrong. Its as if a subtle noise that was comforting your ear has suddenly been snuffed out, its absence your only hint at its presence. Will the light of Siberys grant you divine clarity? Or has it already killed the knight, his body not yet informed?

Geralt's reading:
> The lost child, a wolf born of oak and stone, bird song and a quiet breeze your comfort, your solace, a second home created out of the destruction of another. The creations of man have ripped so much from you. Yes... I feel anger and disgust. But is it born only from what has been taken from you? Or is part of it from knowing, deep down, that your only chance of discovering why you lost everything lies in the story of your family's still-beating heart?

### Lost Child

### Sharn Tension Encounters


Here is a table with some brief encounter ideas for Sharn and related details to help the DM if players investigate further:

| Encounter | Details for DM |
|-|-|  
| A tiefling preacher rants about "end times" while fearful citizens hurry past. | The preacher is a madman named Jorik who claims to receive visions of doom. DC 15 Insight check reveals he seems sincere in his beliefs. |
| Guards question a ragged half-orc about spotting 'Tarks'. | The guards are referring to House Tarkanan agents rumored to be in the area. The half-orc knows nothing. |
| An elf peddles rare demonic tomes from a cart for exorbitant prices. | The elf is a black market dealer named Talian who sells books about devils and demons, including one titled '[[Misc Books and Texts#In the Details An Exploration of Devil Sociology\|In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology]].' |
| A drunk dwarf mutters about the "flame dying out" before being hushed. | He's referring to a secret cult that believes the Silver Flame is fading. DC 13 Persuasion could convince him to share meeting location. |  
| Guards discuss "troubling omens" in hushed tones. | Omens include unnatural fog, aberrant creature sightings, and night terrors afflicting citizens. |
| Strange symbols warn of "ancient lords" and "serpents." | DC 11 Religion or Arcana check identifies them as connected to Overlords of the First Age. |
| An urchin slips a warning about "enemies in masks." | The urchin knows little but has overheard things suggesting shapeshifters or changelings are operating in the city. |
| Cries ring out from a home before a bloodied resident calmly exits. | DC 13 Insight suspects they are under some kind of charm or mind control magic. |
| Guards extinguish blazes sparked by strange green flames. | The flames radiate conjuration magic and have appeared in seemingly random spots around the city. |

## Story Plot Pieces
- **Themes**:
	- What makes a person good? 
	- Better to be born good or overcome evil nature through great struggle?
	- Most villains aren't purely evil, just have their own justifications.
	- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?

- **Central Tension**: The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh
	- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. 
		- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed
		- The silver flame caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so
		- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world

- **Significant NPCs**
	- Varyn "The Valiant" Grayburn
		- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl
		- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame
		- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons
			- Directly oppose actions of the Lords of Dust
			- A small group within felt that Clan Flameforge's scope was too narrow.
			- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.
		- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.
			- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.
			- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.
			- The LoD found out and also began a search.
			- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.
			- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.
		- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.
		- He saw the purity and potential within Draven
			- The darkness within the shard never affected him.
		- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:
			- The White Flameblade
			- The dragonshard fragment
		- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber

	- Aeren d'Cannith
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To discover the extent of House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning
		- Was adopted into House Cannith about 20 years ago at the age of 18 y/o as the Youngest Master Artificer (and only Master Artificer without a Mark of Creation) ever named within the house.
			- Due to his invention of the ingenious Everbright Lantern
		- He is now the Mentor to Miri, the magewright currently living in Shavelant.
		- Aeren knew Geralt's parents for a short time when he was adopted into the House.
		- He does not know what Geralt's schematics say, but he knows that they are written in Sibernyan
		- He knows House Cannith had something to do with the Day of Mourning, and is trying to find out more. (needs development: why does he know something is up?)

**Artifacts**
- Artifact 1: ***Fractured Khyber Dragonshard & Fragments***
	- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.
		- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of them, and have been hunting them down since.
		- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.
	- Contains imprisoned consciousness of Rak Tulkesh
	- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted
	- Who has them
		- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment
		- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment (Needs development, where/how did he find it?)
		- Hrothgar: 1 fragment, obtained from Draven when Hrothgar battled and killed him

- Artifact 2: ***White Flameblade***
	- Currently in Varyn's possession, obtained when he battled and killed Draven
	- Contains runes that tell of the location of the Silver Flame
		- Unlocks a portal in the Mournland that teleports to Vault deep under Xen'Drik jungle
		- sword was created by Varyn when vault was originally sealed, gave it to Draven
		- Varyn felt useless, saw potential in Draven as a protector
		- Aids in travel through the Mournland, glows blue when pointed in the correct direction

- Artifact 3: ***Steelhardt***
	- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.
	- Worked by attaching a willing soul to a Siberys Dragonshard, then implanting the device into a corpse.
	- Marix d'Cannith & the LoD wanted to use it to create an avatar that could wield Rak Tulkesh's power and destroy the Silver Flame
	- This failed because:
		- It was intended for a consciousness to take over a corpse, not to absorb a great power into a living body
		- The consciousness of an Overlord can never be contained within a Siberys Dragonshard, it is too closely connected to Siberys.
	- Instead, the power of Rak Tulkesh corrupted the shard within the device, along with Vorak's body. While this granted him increased power, it came at the cost of a short life.
	- However, when he attempted to destroy the Silver Flame, the awesome power of the Silver Flame broke the Steelhardt's protection mechanisms, allowing the corrupted power to consume Vorak completely. This gave him a quasi-immortality, similar to Lichdom, but cost him his individuality, turning him into a rage-fueled killer.
	- The only way to destroy Vorak is to complete a ritual that can 'cleanse' the corrupted shard within.
	- It can then be used as a way to 'cleanse' Woe?
		- It was made to store a consciousness, so it can be used to steal Rak Tulkesh's consciousness from the Fractured Dragonshard (once the fragments are reunited).

- **Villains**
	- Vorak
		- Underwent ritual before Woe using the Steelhardt and led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.
			- Due to an inherent failure in the Steelhardt, his attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, turning him into a rage-fueled creature of destruction, and allowing the Silver Flame to defend itself with the Mourning.
		- He was sent by Marix d'Clone to kill Geralt's parents after they fled House Cannith.
		- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, feeding off the rage of the survivors, and using it to resurrect himself should he fall in battle.
		- Heart was replaced with the Steelhardt.
			- The survivors get the unrelenting urge to find Vorak and kill him, but if Vorak is dead they find the Steelhardt instead.
			- The rage consumed them, and forces them to plunge the artifact into their own chest, killing them, and allowing Vorak to resurrect through their body.

	- Woe
		- Was killed by Lick's father who was wearing a dragonshard fragment, during a battle in the Last War.
		- He was revived by Mordakesh and the resources of the Lords of Dust.
		- He accepted a deal from Mordakesh to undergo a profane ritual, implanting the main piece of the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard into his chest.
		- This gave him dark powers, sourced from Rak Tulkesh's consciousness, which is trapped within.
		- With the whispers of Rak Tulkesh in his head, he seeks to reunite the shard fragments and use the power to unleash the Overlord upon Eberron once again.

	- Mordakesh
		- Lieutenant to Rak Tulkesh
		- Commands the Lords of Dust & performed ritual on Woe
		- Has been hunting the Dragonshard fragments for a long time
			- Ever since Varyn went looking for them

	- Hrothgar 
		- Bjorn's brother
		- Usurped Bjorn's position as the Chieftian of the Stormpeak Clan
		- Killed Draven and took his fractured dragonshard fragment and white flameblade, further increasing his power and dark taint on the surrounding land.

- **Factions**
	- House Cannith
		- The leader of Cannith south is Marix d'Cannith.
			- He was kidnapped and replaced by a shape-shifting agent (AKA Marix d'Clone) sometime before the Steelhardt was completed and used on Vorack.
			- The real Marix is being held? Or is he dead?
		- Marix d'Clone ordered the use of the Steelhardt in the ritual involving Vorack.
		- He also put the hit out on Geralt's parents.
		- ***Secret***: Marix d'Cannith was replaced by a LoD shapeshifter several years ago, before the Day of Mourning.
		- (Needs developing: Who is the shapeshifter specifically? What are his motivations?)

	- Church of the Silver Flame
		- ***Secret***: Doesn't actually know where the Silver Flame is kept.
		- ***Motivation:*** Find the Silver Flame and claim dominion over it, to protect it.
		- Know of the Boromar Clan's attempts to track down Baelin ir'Torn for the dragonshard fragment.
		- Are working with Baelen trying to locate the Silver Flame, giving him their resources.

	- Boromar clan
		- Seeks the Dragonshard and fragments for none other than the promise of wealth and power

## Encounters
### Dialogue between 2 kobolds
**Nasally Kobold**: "Hey, did you see Brains? He all twitchy and scribbling again."

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Yeah, he mad 'bout the last bunch. Not right for the big wake-up thing. He say Woe trick us."

**Nasally Kobold**: "He keep saying 'need willing ones.' What that mean? We just grab what Woe give, right?"

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Shh! Don't let Brains hear ya. He think he big thinker, say he got plan. But some say he not know anything."

**Nasally Kobold**: "Bah, just want big fire and boom like in prophecy. Brains better be right, or maybe we find new boss, huh?"
### Brain's mutterances

## Enemy goals
- Want to summon [[Argonnessen#Secrets|The Daughter of Khyber]] by doing a ritual sacrifice of a "*Willing Dragon Kin*".

### Prophecy Fragment concerning Tiamat
> In the hour when shadows grow long and the moon bleeds its light, the Daughter of Khyber shall stir in her dark slumber.

### 1 Lead-in


 Dried blood cakes Khorvaire like topsoil, giving way to the blooming flowers of greed, selfishness, and violence. Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. 

102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. 

Blood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.

Powerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. 

House Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.

With no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.

Then 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. 

The signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.

Still, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.

Our story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. 

Deckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.

The smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.

A tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. 

Bjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?

- DO KNOW: they were told to 'keep an eye' on Garhorn.
- DO NOT KNOW: Much else. Basic info about the clan.

### 4 recap


Raided the boromar gang campsite
- Found Garhorn's ledger, his intel on Baelen ir'Torn, and his map of Khorvaire, in addition to loot listed below.
- Killed Orc 1 and Orc 3 during the encounter.
- They healed and interrogated the captured Kobold, who told them that the Sons of the Daughter of Khyber were a very make-shift and disorganized cult. He also told them Brains struck a deal with Woe to take down the airship in session 1 so they could get more people to sacrifice, though he didn't know Woe's name.
	- The party let the kobold escape.
- Let Garhorn and his blink dog Flicker leave alive, along with one of their horses (the one that demanded carrots from Geralt when he used speak with animals).
	- The party did not search Garhorn, he left with his sending stone and special lockpicking set.
	- Garhorn will travel to the closest known Boromar safe house and get aid. He used his sending stone to contact his superior and order a hit out on the party. He will also return to Shavalant with more gang members and burn the town to the ground since they aided the party.
	- PCs took the remaining horse from camp (the one that was very thankful for the apple Geralt fed it).

The party returned to Shavalant soon after, and went to talk to Miri.
- The townsfolk they passed were quite startled by the party and their appearence due to their recent fight with the gang members.
- Miri was concerned at how they handled it, though she was grateful they helped at all.
	- She is afraid that Garhorn will send for more muscle and come back to burn the town to the ground.
	- She relays to the party that she spoke with her mentor Aeren d'Cannith, and that he needs the names of the party so he can aid them through the Sharn gates once they arrive.
	- Miri also told the PCs that he was intrigued about Geralt's steelhardt schematics, though he wouldn't reveal anything over sending stone.
	- (Aeren will recognize Geralt's last name and will begin looking into his family further, suspecting they are connected to House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning.)
- Sheriff Cromley showed up at Miri's workshop during this conversation, very irate. He asked the party to leave, and payed for another horse they could ride out of town.
	- He is concered for the same reasons Miri is, though he is less grateful towards the party than her.
- The PCs stopped by Prissy's apothecary on the way out, and she gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth as thanks for delivering news of her son's passing (which happened in session 1).
- They read the intel letter concernig Baelen and his group of CotSF guards and planned on heading to Sharn, with a possible detour to Castle Arakhain (AKA "The Lighthouse") to investigate a potential lead on the purple crystal he has, hoping to discover more about Woe.

During first day of travel they completed the "It's Kismet" encounter.
- Helped her repair her wagon using some glue she had.
- She announced herself as a seer and offered palm readings. Things got weird fast and she gave their fate readings detailed in the encounter.
- The party left shortly after, a bit freaked out.
- Bjorn was less jolted by the encounter, due to his mother being the Stormpeak Clan's seer.

Found the remains of the skirmish between Baelen's guards and the LoD ambush.
- Found the initial clues about the ambush, investigated the scene a bit.
- Bjorn spotted the path leading towards the creek bed that contains the dead Knight Templar.
- The party elected to set up camp a short distance away from the skirmish site and long rest before investigating further.

## Bjorn "Bear Wolf" Ulfr

### Hooks to remember

- His brother became drowned by greed due to the presence Rak Tulkesh demi-plane near the mountains?
- Traveling to Sharn for a lead on his brother?
### Race/Class/Alignment
- Goliath Barbarian
- Lawful Neutral

### Background
- Soldier
- Was the Chieftain of the Stormpeak clan in the Graywall Mountains of Droaam
- Was usurped by his younger brother, Hrothgar.
### Backstory
Bjorn-Ulfr was born into the Goliath tribe known as the Stormpeak Clan, a hardy and fierce group that roamed the rugged mountains of the northern lands. From a young age, Bjorn-Ulfr showed signs of great strength and resilience, surpassing even the most seasoned warriors in the tribe. His towering stature and relentless determination earned him the respect of his people, and it wasn't long before he was seen as a natural leader.

As he grew older, Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership qualities became more apparent, and it was clear that he would one day become the chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan. Under his guidance, the clan flourished, becoming a force to be reckoned with in the harsh wilderness. Bjorn-Ulfr's sense of honor and loyalty was unwavering, and he made it a priority to protect his people from external threats while fostering a strong sense of unity among his tribe.

Bjorn-Ulfr had a younger brother, Hrothgar, who was also a formidable warrior but lacked the same moral compass as his older sibling. As the years passed, Hrothgar's ambition and lust for power grew. He became increasingly envious of Bjorn-Ulfr's status and the adoration he received from the clan. Hrothgar's jealousy festered, and he began plotting to usurp his brother's position as chieftain.

One fateful night, Hrothgar betrayed his brother, orchestrating a coup against Bjorn-Ulfr and seizing control of the clan through treachery and deceit. Bjorn-Ulfr, who had always been trusting and believed in the inherent goodness of his people, was taken by surprise. Defeated and cast out by his own brother, Bjorn-Ulfr was left to wander the harsh wilderness alone.

With the betrayal still fresh in his heart, Bjorn-Ulfr embarked on a path of self-discovery and redemption. He channeled his anger, pain, and loss into becoming an even more formidable warrior, delving into the ways of the barbarian to hone his rage. As he roamed the wild, he formed new alliances and built a following of loyal outcasts and like-minded individuals who sought justice and vengeance against the treacherous Hrothgar.

Bjorn-Ulfr's ultimate goal became to confront his brother and restore the rightful order within the Stormpeak Clan. The memory of the betrayal fueled his determination to bring Hrothgar to justice, not only for his own sake but to reclaim the honor and legacy of their people. Under Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership, his ragtag group of followers would stop at nothing to right the wrongs committed by his own flesh and blood and restore his place as the true chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan.

## Sylas Stormshadow (deceased)

### Hooks to Remember
- His pact with 'The Traveler' was actually made with some other eldritch being? 
- Sul Khatesh?
### Race & Class
- Half-Elf Warlock
- Chaotic Neutral
### Background
- Sage
- Born in the Sharn Underground to an Elvish scholar father and Human merchant mother
- Warlock of the Traveler
### Backstory
Sylas Stormshadow, the enigmatic half-elf warlock of chaotic neutral alignment, has a backstory filled with mystery and the enigmatic presence of the Traveler.

Born to a human mother and an elven father, Sylas's life was marked by a turbulent blend of cultures and a thirst for power. Here is his revised backstory:

Sylas was born in the bustling coastal city of Sharn, where humans and elves coexisted in an uneasy alliance. His father, a reclusive elven scholar, had a fascination with forbidden knowledge and the enigmatic aspects of magic. Sylas's mother was a human merchant who embraced the chaos of the city's underbelly. From her, Sylas learned his first taste of anarchy and rebellion.

From an early age, Sylas displayed an insatiable curiosity for the arcane, an unquenchable thirst for power, and an innate ability to bend others to his will. Though concerned about his son's choices, his father could not deny the potential within him and reluctantly taught Sylas the basics of eldritch magic. Sylas quickly surpassed his father's teachings and delved into darker tomes and rituals, seeking the forbidden secrets that eldritch beings held.

One fateful night, during an illicit ritual deep in the city's labyrinthine sewers, Sylas made a pact with the mysterious and enigmatic Traveler. The Traveler granted Sylas otherworldly powers in exchange for his servitude and adherence to its unpredictable whims. Its motives were always veiled in mystery, and its presence brought chaos and intrigue to Sylas's life.

The Traveler's influence transformed Sylas into a warlock with the power to manipulate time, reality, and fate. But in return, the Traveler would randomly manifest its presence, whisking Sylas away to alternate realities and planes, often leaving him to navigate unforeseen challenges.

### Background

- Born in Byeshk Mountains
### Backstory
Draven Flameforge was born into the proud and ancient clan of Flameforge, a lineage of dragonborn warriors renowned for their devotion to Siberys, the Dragon Above. From an early age, Draven's destiny seemed clear. He was marked with the innate power of draconic blood in his veins, and his family recognized his potential to become a great champion of justice and protector of the weak.

Raised in the remote mountains, Draven grew up surrounded by the teachings of his clan. He was trained in the art of combat, his every move guided by the principles of honor, loyalty, and righteousness. His mentor, an elderly paladin named Varyn the Valiant, recognized Draven's exceptional dedication and took him under his wing. Varyn honed Draven's skills as a warrior and instilled in him the importance of upholding the tenets of Siberys. 

As Draven matured, he became increasingly aware of the growing darkness plaguing the world. Tales of evil forces spreading corruption and chaos deeply troubled him, and he felt a calling to stand against them. Driven by his unwavering faith and the desire to protect the innocent, Draven pledged himself to the service of Siberys as a paladin. Embarking on his quest, Draven left his clan and set forth into the wider world. 

He traveled to distant lands, seeking to combat evil and bring justice to those who had been wronged. Along his journey, he encountered various threats, both mortal and supernatural, and faced numerous challenges that tested his resolve and strengthened his faith. Draven's draconic heritage played a significant role in his path. He embraced his lineage, seeing it as a gift bestowed upon him by Siberys himself. He learned to harness his dragonborn abilities, channeling the elemental power of lightning into his strikes, using his breath weapon as a devastating tool against his enemies. 

Driven by a deep sense of duty, Draven Flameforge became a beacon of hope in an ever-darkening world. He fought valiantly against the forces of darkness, vanquishing wicked creatures, thwarting diabolical plots, and defending the innocent. His unwavering commitment to justice and his dedication to the teachings of Siberys made him a respected figure among paladins and a symbol of hope for those in need. As Draven Flameforge's legend grew, his name became synonymous with righteousness and valor. He continued to roam the land, his flaming sword shining brightly, a testament to his unwavering resolve.
