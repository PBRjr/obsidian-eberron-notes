# Brainstorms

## Aeren putting together the dots


Aeren puts together the dots of what the party told him
He learned:
- Modern warforged are the product of the souls of dead soldiers, wiped of their memories and transferred into warforged bodies.
- Geralt's parents created schematics for a strange heart mechanism and wrote it down in an ancient draconic language. The shopping list he found probably has something to do with that
- He concluded that the mechanism has to have something to do with transferring the souls of soldiers into the warforged, especially with them studying a lich phylactery to create it.
- He recognizes the script from an old nursery rhyme his mother used to read to him. He finds the old book, titled "*When the Couatl sing*" and realized it was a draconic script that used to be used by the most devout followers of Siberys, the Dragon Above.
- He went to the library to do research on the language. Unable to find anything on the language, he asked the librarian for their books on religious history. He checked out a book titled "*Godlings, Demigods, and other Mythical Creatures*" and left.
- On his way back, he ran into Boromar Clan thugs, who kidnapped him at the order of Halak Boromar. (He is wanted for his technological ability and knowledge of the arcane. They want to use him to work with the professor and figure out the use/purpose of the FKD fragment they got from the professor.)
- When he is kidnapped, he dropped his book on the ground, which can be found by the party.
- The gang members can also be encountered and looted, and [[Aeren's Written Notes]] may be looted.

They have established smaller workshops and outposts throughout [[Khorvaire]], seeking opportunities to regain their prominence in the creation and sale of magical items.

Race: Halfling

---

While the exact prices for specific treatments may vary, House Jorasco always strives to find a balance between sustaining their operations and fulfilling their mission of providing healing and restoration to all who seek it.

---

### Diamond Conspiracy
Immortality is bad for business. House Jorasco thrives on being the premier source of healing and ressurection, the latter part of which generates them a significant amount of money. Cheap ressurection isn't easy to come by - and House Jorasco leaders make sure it stays that way.

The lowest and most available form of true ressurection is _Revivify_. With access to a large diamond, any common cleric could perform ressurection services, potentially sucking away profits and renown from Jorasco clerics.

Did you know diamonds really aren't that hard to find? In fact, Eberron has a wealth of diamonds in it's cave systems. However, shady contracts, lobbying, and intimidation with governments and land owners has allowed House Jorasco to establish a near monopoly on diamond mining, allowing them to exponentially inflate their price.

This is a secret kept close to the House's chest, and they don't take kindly to purchased from unsanctioned dealers, nor do they enjoy lowly adventurers asking questions.

## Anonymous Letters


A minion of an overlord has been using the prophecy to send letters to Thora Tarkanan in hopes of starting a complete civil war within the city that will lead to total war throughout Khorvaire.

## Boromar Challenge Coin


## Description
This small coin appears to be made entirely of copper, when tested it is found to have a small magnetic property. 

On one side of the coin is a symbol representing a **silver dragon with folded wings perched on a tower**. On the other side is the [[Boromar clan|Boromar clan's]] motto:

> One need not be tall to stand atop the highest tower.

These coins are commonly used among Boromar operatives as a method of inter-agent authentication.

## Spy report 1
Subject: Mournland Activity
Date: 14 Eyre, 998YK 

Observation Report:

Marix's agents were seen entering the Mournland via the Dead-Gray Mist on three separate occasions. Locations marked on attached map. Attempts to follow have resulted in loss of contact with three operatives. 

No definitive connection between Mourning and weapons confirmed. Further investigation required, but advised caution.

End of report.

## Spy report 2
Subject: Weapon Production Methods
Date: 3 Nymm, 998YK

Observation Report:

Multiple shipments from the Mournland were tracked to Marix's facilities via lightning rale. Contents unknown, but believed to be related to Mourning weapons. Security is high.

An operative managed to infiltrate the premises but was discovered before gathering substantial information. Operative's last message mentioned something to do with "Captured Essence."

Further investigation is underway but has proven highly risky.

End of report.


## Incriminating Documents
To whom it may concern,

After careful consideration of the recent events and the opportunities they present, I have decided to move forward with the Mourn weapon production. Our connections within House Tarkanan shall remain discreet, and I assure you that our transactions will be conducted with the utmost secrecy.

The newly produced prototypes have proven quite functional. I am convinced that our collaboration will not only be profitable but also lead to significant advancements in arcane weaponry.

Best regards,

Marix d'Cannith


## Dragon Blood


> "Dragon's Blood is a magical phenomenon unlike any other. It enables the user to tap into a crude, unstable form of the primal forces of magic. But like handling raw elemental forces, the risks far outweigh the fleeting benefits. This drug not only wreaks havoc on the user's physical form but also destabilizes the very magical essence of their being. The uncontrolled magical outbursts are akin to trying to direct a thunderstorm with a tin roof - unpredictable, chaotic, and more often than not, disastrous."
<span class="right-align">-Illicit Magical Substance (IMS) researcher, Morgrave University</span>
---

Dragon Blood, also known as Blood or Heat, is an illegal substance commonly found in the lower levels of [[Sharn]]. In its raw form, it is a thick, iridescent liquid that shifts color in the light, reminiscent of an oil slick or a soap bubble. It is typically consumed by dropping the liquid onto the tongue, where it absorbs quickly into the bloodstream, causing an immediate and potent effect.

Users often describe the initial effects as a sensation of warmth spreading throughout the body, a quickening of the senses, and an unexplainable feeling of being deeply connected to the mystical weave of magic that permeates the world. Regular users become addicted, not just to the drug's effects but also to the feeling of power and the illusions of insight into the magical world around them.

However, the drug's long-term effects can be devastating. Prolonged use of Dragon's Blood results in physical deterioration and mental instability, as the body struggles to cope with the sudden influx of magical energy. It can lead to hallucinations, erratic behavior, and in the worst cases, wild magical outbursts.

---

The following is a table of random magical effects Dragon's Blood might trigger. The effects of each last for 1 minute, or 10 rounds, unless specified otherwise. 

1. The user emits a bright light in a 30-foot radius.
2. The next spell cast by the user targets a random creature within range, but does not use a spell slot. If the spell has an AOE, it is cast centered on a random creature in range.
3. The user vomits relentlessly, losing their next turn and gaining 1 point of exhaustion.
4. The user can only speak in haiku.
5. The user becomes enlarged, but gains a level of exhaustion once the effect wears off.
6. The user is under the effect of the invisibility spell for the duration.
7. The user gains a flying speed equal to their walking speed. If the user already has a flying speed, it doubles.
8. The user immediately casts Fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on themselves.
9. For the next minute, all the user's melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage, both to the target and the user.
10. The user is affected as if by the Polymorph spell, transformed into a sheep for the duration.

## Dragonshards


Dragonshards are fragments of the bodies of the progenitor dragons, and each type is associated with one of the dragons. These mystical stones have the ability to hold and channel magical energy, making them an integral part of many magical items and spells. They come in three types: Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron shards, each with unique characteristics and applications.

---

**Eberron Dragonshards**
Eberron shards, also known as "dragon's blood" (not to be confused with [[Dragon Blood]]) or bloodstones, are the most common type. They are typically found in rock formations or riverbeds across the world of Eberron. This shard's radiant, multicolored veins stand in stark contrast to its otherwise transparent exterior. Eberron shards are used to bind elemental creatures and power the mighty airships and lightning rails. They also play a vital role in the creation and operation of the Warforged and sentient constructs. ^90b643

---

**Siberys Dragonshards**
Siberys shards, or "dragon's tears", are the rarest and most coveted of the three. They are not found in the ground but instead fall from the Ring of Siberys that encircles the world. These shards are golden and exhibit a radiant glow. They are predominantly used for the creation of dragonmarks and serve as key components in the highest echelons of artifice. The Siberys shards are coveted by those with dragonmarks, as they can augment and enhance their powers. ^b906e5

---

**Khyber Dragonshards**
Khyber shards, known as "dragon's teeth", are found deep within the world, in the underdark and other subterranean locales. These shards have a sinister, dark hue, often perceived as an abyssal black or a deep blue. Khyber shards are used to create binding circles and magic items that contain or utilize fiends or other extraplanar entities. Their energy is considered potent but unpredictable, which often leads to their use in more nefarious magical applications. ^023b44



## Forge Knowledge Handout


**Does know**
- Warforged were made using the souls of fallen soldiers during the last war.
- Their creation involved trapping the soul in some kind of metal heart.
	- It looks like a small sphere with runes engraved on it, which subtly glowed with a golden-violet hue.
 - Forge was created in the first batch of modern warforged - and the only one that didn't lose his mind due to his new found form. All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.
 - All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead soldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.
 - In a battle during the last war, he sacrificed his and his men's lives in an explosion he set off to overtake the enemy. 
 - Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and infused into a warforged body. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.
 - Near the end of the war, he broke free and, using his skills from his past life, destroyed his creation forge.
	- He obtained information on his creation, including the methods that were still being used to create new warforged.
	- He threatened to go public with that [[forge knowledge handout|info]]. 
	- Knowing he would be unable to destroy all of the forges on his own, he forced House Cannith's hand into signing the Treaty of Thronehold and shutting down all creation forges, ending the production of new Warforged.
	- He didn't go public because in the back of his mind he knew one day he may want to "have children" or create new warforged in his name.
- When he was a human, Forge was blessed with a Mark of Making. As a warforged, his soul carried the mark to his new warforged body, which is now displayed as originating from his chest and creeping out to the rest of his body similarly to a system of veins and arteries that carry an ambient subtle glow who's color reflects his current mood.
- He is still being chased by agents of House Cannith to recover his blackmail and continue to study him.
- He has a note ripped out of an artificer's journal he found prior to destroying his creation forge.
- He was at The Lighthouse because he knew it contained a portal to Sharn.

### Artificer Journal Page Handout

---
The latest series of experiments aimed at recreating The Prototype has once again ended in failure. The primary challenge continues to be the integration of both Khyber and Siberys dragonshards into a single cohesive device.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Energetic Incompatibility:** When attempting to merge Khyber and Siberys dragonshards, the inherent properties of each shard result in violent energetic reactions. The Khyber shard's chaotic dark energy and the Siberys shard's radiant light energy create a destabilizing feedback loop, leading to catastrophic device failure.

3. **Material Fracture:** Even with the most refined binding agents and stabilization matrices, the structural integrity of the device cannot withstand the opposing forces of the shards. Repeated trials show that the casing fractures under the pressure, often shattering both the dragonshards and the housing materials.

3. **Arcane Conductivity Issues:** The arcane circuits designed to channel the combined energies of both shards are proving inadequate. The conduits either overload or burn out, unable to handle the simultaneous flow of both types of energy. This results in significant power loss and unpredictable surges.

**Current Adjustments & Theories:**
- **Single Shard Usage:** Given the repeated failures with dual-shard integration, we have temporarily shifted our focus to single shard implementations. Utilizing only a Khyber or Siberys shard simplifies the energy matrix, but this solution is incomplete and leads to noted psychosis in test subjects. The posthumous cooperation of fallen soldiers provides critical insights, yet their spirits are less stable under these conditions. Stabilization methods are in testing phase and are proving effective. 

- **Arcane Filtration:** We are exploring the potential of using arcane filters or buffers to mediate the energies of the two shards. The idea is to create a phased energy conduit that can sequentially manage the influx and outflux of each shard's energy rather than attempting simultaneous integration.

### Description

- A shattered [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber Dragonshard]] the size of a fist, covered in ancient draconic runes with a faint glow pulsing from within
- The gem is warm to the touch and has a gentle pulsing vibration.
- It has 4 visible chunks taken out of it, which clearly bore additional runes that are now missing.

### History

- As a part of the ancient ritual involving the sacrifice of the Couatl, Rak Tulkesh's avatar was separated from his demi planes, exposing a vulnerability. 
- Beaten by a force of ancient dragons, consciousness was sealed away in this Dragonshard.
- To keep it out of the hands of the [[Lords of Dust]], it was shattered, its fragments spread across the world.

### Powers/Abilities

- The Dragonshard contains the fragmented power of Rak Tulkesh.
- These shards are the sources of power [[Woe]] is seeking.
- They can be combined with a soul through a ritual, giving the user power, but also corrupting them.
- Once they are all combined again, the user's soul will be consumed as fuel to release Rak Tulkesh's avatar from its bonds.
- Can only be properly wielded by one that is *tainted*
	- One is tainted when they are born or die while in immediate proximity to the shard or its fragments
### Location

- The main gem is [[Woe#Abilities & Powers|Woe's phylactery]]
	- Lick: 1 Shard before airship crash
	- [[Professor Baelen ir'Torn]]: 1 Shard
	- 2 remaining shards: unknown

### Interacting With It

- Touching a shard gives the wielder a sense of unimaginable power that has been splintered and broken, as if the vastness of it is unreachable, just beyond the horizon.
- The shard can not be destroyed while a part of Rak Tulkesh's power remains within. It can only be fractured and contained.

### Hook
- The Silver Flame is constantly searching for it, even ransacking the Players quarters if they find out about it.
- [[Woe]] seeks to increase his power using the shards
- [[Mordakesh]] seeks to consume Woe's soul with the completed Dragonshard and unleash his master.

## Godlings, Demigods, and Other Mythical Creatures


#### Followers of Siberys and the Couatl

>Throughout history, numerous groups have devoted themselves to the worship of Siberys, the great dragon above, and the revered Couatl. These followers, including the Knights of the Silver Sky and the Order of the Eternal Dawn, have risen and fallen with time, each leaving a mark upon Eberron's history.
>
>Yet, none but one of these groups have endured since the legendary sacrifice of the Couatl. This one enduring group is believed to live secluded in the Byeshk Mountains, though this remains largely rumor, with no definitive evidence of their existence. Their name and true nature are lost to history, shrouded in mystery and legend.

## Jonston's Note


This piece of worn parchment has obviously seen the wear-and-tear of an active lifestyle. If Jon was killed it also has some blood smears on it.

> Dear Jonny,
> 
> I miss you so much since you left [[Shavalant]]. The house feels empty without your laughter filling it up. I hope you are doing okay on your travels. 
> 
> Things have been odd around here lately. The animals have been riled up, especially at night. Folks say they hear weird noises coming from the Whitehorn Woods. I'm sure it's nothing to worry over, but it would be nice to have you home. 
> 
> I'm going to bake your favorite blueberry pie for when you visit. I can't wait to see your smiling face and hear about your adventures. Please be careful and come back soon. You're always in my prayers.

## Legacy Stone


### Description:

- This shimmering Siberys Dragonshard is 2 inches long with the diameter of a grape. It has a rapid, darting glow, as though something is bouncing off the inner walls of the shard, trying to find an exit.
### Interacting With It:

- Once per long rest, when Geralt concentrates for at least 10 minutes while holding the Legacy Stone, he experiences a surge of warmth before his mind is flooded with a memory that is chosen at random from the table below.

***First Interaction***
>The Siberys dragonshard pulses warmly in your hand, its golden light seeping into your skin. For a moment, the workshop fades, replaced by a rush of sensations, emotions, and fragmented images. It’s not your memory, you realize, but hers. You are seeing the world through your mother's eyes, feeling the world through her body.

| 6   | The Rageblight       |         |

***Memory Descriptions***
**Kismet's Prophecy:** 
> The world shimmers, your senses flooded with the sights and smells of a crowded marketplace. You feel a small hand clutching yours as you and Norbit stand before a half-elf woman with striking eyes. She traces lines on your palm, her touch strangely warm. An unsettling feeling of knowing, of seeing threads of destiny intertwining, washes over you. She doesn't speak, but images flash through your mind – a towering city, a shattered land, a powerful artifact, a young boy facing a daunting task. A cold dread grips your heart.

**Norbit's Illness:**
> The air is heavy with the scent of parchment and ink. Lamplight flickers across a cluttered desk, illuminating diagrams and notes. You feel Norbit's hand trembling in yours as he coughs, a rattling sound that echoes in the silence. A wave of nausea washes over you, not from the illness, but from the crushing realization that time is slipping away. You glance at a drawing of a complex device, its intricate workings promising a solution, a chance to cheat fate.

**Sibernyan Discovery:**
>Wind howls outside, rattling the shutters of a small, isolated cabin perched atop a snow-covered mountain. Inside, a fire crackles in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on rough-hewn walls. You feel a mixture of anticipation and unease as you sit across a table from a figure shrouded in a thick cloak, his face obscured by the shadows. As he speaks, his voice is a low, melodic rumble, unlike any language you've ever heard. You sense an ancient wisdom, a connection to something beyond mortal comprehension. Norbit leans forward, his brow furrowed in concentration as he grasps the strange words, responding in kind.

**Steelhardt Prototype:** 
>The air vibrates with energy, tingling your skin. A faint humming sound fills the chamber as you and Norbit stand before a pulsing device. You feel a surge of triumph as you complete the final connection, the culmination of years of research. A brilliant light flares, momentarily blinding you, then fades, leaving behind a sense of awe and a lingering taste of ozone. A deep, primal fear whispers within you, a warning about the choices you've made, about the forces you've put into motion. You've done what no one else could, you've conquered a primal force of nature with nothing but your minds. You should be relieved. And yet, you can't shake the feeling that you just changed the course of the world in more ways than you can imagine. 

**House Cannith Escape:**
>Rain lashes your face, cold and relentless. Your heart pounds in your chest as you and Norbit race through the dark, winding alleys, a crying young boy clutched in your arms. You feel the presence of pursuers, their footsteps echoing on the cobblestones. You turn a corner, praying you lost them. Norbit squeezes your shoulder as you calm the boy whose head is nuzzling into your shirt. Terror grips you, fueled by the knowledge that you're not just protecting yourselves, but something far more precious, something that could change the world.

**The Rageblight**
> Three inch thick glass encased by cold steel is all that separates yourself and Norbit from... him. He's strapped to an exam table by concrete reinforced bindings that stress and crack as he strains against them. Dark red veins spider-web across his skin, which looks as though its been stretched across his body, as though any more tension would cause it to rip and tear in places. A large scar runs down the middle of his chest, inflamed and irritated. His eyes are jet black. "I don't know why this happened," you say aloud, "Our math checked out. The components were good. There's got to be something we're missing." Norbit starts a reply, but its interrupted with a cough from his lungs and a splatter of blood in his palm. Marix talks over him, his eyes fixed on the creature in the other room, "This is what happens if we get this wrong. He was one of my best before he volunteered. Now... I don't think there's anything left of him inside." The thing on the other side of the glass began to scream and strain against his bindings. The one holding his left arm splinters and shatters. He reaches over to start destroying his other bindings, but then a blue gas vents into the room, and he calms. "Now he's just a mistake... and an example. Don't get it wrong again."
### Location:

- Behind an impenetrable locked door in [[Wolfsbane Workshop]]

### Ownership/Affiliation: 

- House Cannith has been trying to get behind the locked door since Geralt's parents fled House Cannith.

### Significance: 

- Contained within are flashbacks to important memories in Yelena's life, from her perspective. They were planted in this stone by his parents for Geralt to find.

## Day of Mourning


The age of demons exposed the world to the power of the Overlords. Great, terrifying, and nearly unstoppable, a single overlord freed of its bonds can assert its domain across an entire country. 

The [[Dragons of Argonnessen]], combined with the full force of the [[Couatl]], waged a war against the [[Overlords]]. Weaving the threads of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], the Couatl sacrificed their collective life force to form the Silver Flame, forever imprisoning the Overlords by separating their consciousness from the power of their Heart Demi planes.

Though they can be imprisoned, the Overlords can never be defeated. In modern times, with the Last War's destruction threatening to plunge the entirety of Khorvaire into chaos, the [[Lords of Dust]] threaten to use the prophecy to break their lords bonds.

After learning the location of the Silver Flame, [[Varak the Rageblight]] led demonic forces into the depths of its containment. Armed with the misleading power granted to him by the [[Steelhardt]], Vorak attacked the Silver Flame. It defended itself by releasing a portion of its power, causing the Mourning. The protection mechanisms of the Steelhardt within Vorak broke under the awesome power of the Flame's retaliation, corrupting Vorak into a rage-fueled killer, cursed to Lich-dom.

## Draconic Prophecy


> The falling of a tree, the flap of a butterflies wings, the whispers of wind in man's ear. It is not known what drove the universe to create such an eternal living document. That's what unique about chaos - sometimes, things just happen. 
<span class="right-align">-Professor Baelen ir'Torn</span>
---
## Functionality
The prophecy isn't a document that tells of all that will be. Its more like an observation of specific circumstances that give a series of if-then statements in regard to the universe. Only an ancient or powerful being may have the knowledge to interpret these signs into any useful knowledge.

- [[The Chamber]] actively works to use the prophecy to engineer favorable results in the world.
- The [[Lords of Dust]] actively work to use the prophecy to free their [[Overlords]].

## In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology
In the intricate tapestry of Eberron's planes, the societal structures of fiends, especially those from the plane of Fernia, the Sea of Fire, exhibit a complexity rivaling that of the most convoluted mortal civilizations. Each fiend, from the minor rakshasas roaming the material plane to the formidable overlords shackled in Khyber, occupies a distinct niche within their fiery domain. This hierarchy, while seemingly rigid, is propelled by a constant undercurrent of ambition and subterfuge, as each entity vies for power, influence, and the opportunity to extend their reach beyond their infernal confines.

Central to the social dynamics of Fernia's denizens is the manipulation of mortal desires and fears through pacts and bargains. These agreements, etched in the essence of the plane itself, are not mere exchanges but pivotal events that can alter the fate of realms. Fiends, with their unparalleled cunning, craft these pacts to ensnare the unwary, trading momentary boons for eternal servitude or influence. Such transactions underscore the fiends' understanding of value, power, and the lengths to which they will go to achieve their ends. Through the lens of these interactions, "In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology" sheds light on the intricate dance of dominance and dependence that defines the existence of Eberron's most malevolent beings.

### Historic Treaty of Thronehold Ushers In New Era of Peace


The Treaty of Thronehold, a significant document promising to redefine the landscape of Khorvaire, has been signed. This landmark agreement signals the end of the Last War that has plagued our continent for over a century.

The signing ceremony took place in Thronehold Castle, the former seat of Galifar's power. Representatives from each of the twelve recognized nations set aside their bitterness and assembled to formally declare an end to hostilities. 

The Treaty delineates boundaries and acknowledges sovereignty, granting each nation its rightfully earned autonomy. These nations include Aundair, Breland, Cyre - now mournfully referred to as The Mournland - Darguun, Droaam, The Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, The Lhazaar Principalities, The Mror Holds, Q'Barra, The Talenta Plains and Thrane.

The agreement also declares that House Cannith will dismantle Creation Forges across Khorvaire and cease Warforged production henceforth. This clause aims to prevent any future escalation of conflict by stemming the creation of magically manufactured soldiers.

Furthermore, it recognizes Warforged as sentient beings with rights equal to those enjoyed by other denizens of Khorvaire. This groundbreaking recognition marks a progressive step in our continent's history.

However, the treaty leaves several contentious issues unresolved. Notably absent are provisions addressing war reparations or specific terms for demilitarization. Additionally, several regions and factions remain unrecognized by the Treaty; this includes Shadow Marches and Valenar who argue for their sovereignty.

While critics express concerns over these omissions potentially sowing seeds for future conflicts; optimists view this as an opportunity for continuing diplomatic negotiations in a newfound atmosphere of peace.

The Treaty signifies not only an end but also a new beginning – a chance for our war-torn continent to heal its wounds and move towards unity and prosperity. It is indeed a monumental milestone in Khorvaire’s history which we should all cherish cautiously while working towards establishing lasting peace.


### Mysterious Calamities Plague Outlying Settlements


SHARN INQUISITOR

MYSTERIOUS CALAMITIES PLAGUE OUTLYING SETTLEMENTS

In recent weeks, reports of inexplicable devastation have trickled in from several small towns and villages across Breland and neighboring regions. Eyewitness accounts describe scenes of utter destruction, with buildings reduced to rubble and farmlands scorched beyond recognition. Authorities remain baffled by the cause of these incidents, with theories ranging from freak magical storms to rampaging elementals.

"It was like nothing I've ever seen," said Mira Thornhaven, a merchant who narrowly escaped the destruction of Millbrook, a small farming community near the Droaam border. "One moment all was calm, the next... it was as if the very earth was screaming."

House Jorasco healers have been dispatched to affected areas, tending to survivors who speak of an overwhelming sense of rage and despair in the wake of the destruction. King Boranel's court has yet to make an official statement on these events.

  

UNDERWORLD UNREST: GANG VIOLENCE SURGES IN LOWER WARDS

Tensions continue to rise in Sharn's lower wards as an ongoing turf war between rival gangs escalates. The City Watch reports an uptick in violence, particularly in the Callestan district.

Sources close to the investigation suggest that the conflict centers around control of the lucrative dreamlily trade, with the Boromar Clan and Daask at the heart of the struggle. Residents report frequent skirmishes and suspicious disappearances, while local businesses suffer from increased "protection" fees. The situation has prompted calls for increased City Watch presence, but critics argue this may only inflame tensions further. Commander Iyanna ir'Talan of the Daggerwatch Garrison assures citizens that "all necessary measures" are being taken to restore order, but declined to provide specifics, citing ongoing operations.

Giant Runes and New Routes

Morgrave University has announced a breakthrough in the study of Xen'drik artifacts, with Professor Gellen ir'Korran claiming to have deciphered previously unknown Giant runes. This development promises to shed new light on pre-Galifar history.

House Orien has unveiled plans for an expanded lightning rail network, promising faster travel times between major cities. Critics argue the project may disrupt local ecosystems, while supporters hail it as a necessary step for continued economic growth.

### Skyway's Floating Gardens Flourish with Rare Flora


In a delightful spectacle of nature's resilience, Skyway's floating gardens have become home to a rare species of luminescent flowers, previously thought to be native only to the [[Eldeen Reaches]]. The flowers, known as Starlight Blossoms, have begun to bloom in the high towers of [[Sharn]], casting an enchanting glow over the city's skyline.

The sudden appearance of these flowers has sparked mild curiosity among the citizens and a few scholarly debates in [[Morgrave University|Morgrave University's]] hallowed halls. Botanists are intrigued by how these flowers, typically found in the mystical groves of the Eldeen Reaches, have adapted to the urban environment of Sharn.

In the political landscape, this event has been largely met with passive interest. Some members of the [[Aurum]] have taken to decorating their estates with these glowing blossoms, viewing them as a status symbol. Meanwhile, [[House Vadalis]], bearers of the Mark of Handling and known for their expertise in flora and fauna, have expressed a desire to study these flowers further.

While the Starlight Blossoms' arrival is a minor event in the grand scheme of Sharn's bustling life, it serves as a gentle reminder of the world's enduring magic and mystery. As the city continues its daily hustle and bustle, the Starlight Blossoms glow quietly, adding a touch of serene beauty to the City of Towers.

### Concept

Woe is a decommissioned warforged soldier who served with distinction in the Last War. After the Treaty of Thronehold left him without purpose, he willingly underwent a profane ritual by Mordakesh to replace his heart with a Khyber dragonshard fragment, granting him sinister powers as a [[Woe#Abilities & Powers|Warlock Lich]].  

### Description 

- Appearance: A bulky, 7 ft tall warforged with numerous battle scars. His eyes glow an ominous purple. The hollow cavity in his chest flickers with a faint violet light.     ![[Woe portrait.png|right|230]]

- Personality: Driven by a sense of purpose and duty, but his methods are merciless. Has disdain for the "weakness" of living creatures.  

- Mannerisms: Speaks in a commanding, metallic voice, with a prose that is strong but short and to-rhe-point. Carries out orders swiftly and efficiently. Never wastes movements in combat.

### Backstory

Woe was an elite warforged soldier constructed centuries ago by House Cannith. He was unwaveringly loyal and skilled in warfare. One day in the midst of battle, Woe was struck down and killed by a halfling known as *Dandal*.

Dandal had been carrying a "lucky" family heirloom - a small fragment of a larger [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] - which attached a dark cancer upon Woe's soul as he died. 

Woe awoke, months later, in the laboratories of [[Mordakhesh]], having been revived and put back together, piece-by-piece.

Mordakesh promised him a new reason for being - serving the overlord Rak Tulkesh. Woe agreed to undergo a profane ritual that fused a Khyber dragonshard fragment containing a sliver of the overlord's essence into his metallic body, awakening sinister powers.

### Motivations

- Regain the sense of purpose he felt during the Last War
- Give all warforged the new purpose he has now found, serving a greater power.
- Hunt down fractured Khyber dragonshards to increase his power

### Foreboding Premonitions
**Disturbed Dreams:** Players experience vivid nightmares where they're battling an overwhelming purple darkness, or Woe himself, only to wake up with a sense of dread. These dreams could occasionally provide cryptic clues or warnings about Woe's plans, wrapped in metaphorical imagery related to Woe's backstory or abilities.

**Purple Lightning:** Before a significant encounter or event linked to Woe, the sky could be lit by rare and unnatural purple lightning, even without a storm. This phenomenon, witnessed by the players or recounted by locals, serves as an omen of Woe's direct involvement or the presence of his power.

**Reflections in Water:** On occasion, when the players look into still water, their reflections could momentarily shift to show them as lifeless, puppet-like versions of themselves, with glowing purple eyes. This unsettling vision fades quickly but leaves an eerie feeling of being marked by Woe.

### Abilities & Powers

- Granted Warlock-like abilities from his patron [[Rak Tulkesh]].
- His phylactery is the [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber shard]] resting in the center of his chest.
- The shard contains both a small sliver of Rak Tulkesh's power and part of Woe's soul.
- The dragonshard is indestructible, due to the power contained within.
	- If Woe is killed, his soul will remain in the shard until it can take over the body of another creature
	- As Woe gathers more [[Fractured Khyber Dragonshard]] fragments, Rak Tulkesh's influence over Woe will grow until he is completely under the Overlord's control.

### Connections & Hooks

- Attacked the PCs' airship to capture a dragonshard fragment!
- Carries out violent raids to obtain shards scattered across Khorvaire.
- Seeking to use resources of other factions to find the remaining shattered khyber dragonshards

## Travel
### Travel Time
Travel in Sharn can be unpredictable. Residents joke that it takes about an hour to get anywhere, whether it’s just down three levels in the same tower or all the way across town. Of course, skycoaches reduce the time dramatically compared to walking from place to place, and characters who really know their way around (as well as characters who are willing to ask for directions frequently along the way) can get to their destinations more quickly than newcomers who refuse to display their ignorance. 

If it becomes important to know how long it takes to get from one place to another, use the following rules of thumb:

| Mode of Travel and Destination         | Travel Time*    |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Foot Travel                            |                 |
| Destination in same district           | 3d6 minutes     |
| Destination in same ward               | 6d6 minutes     |
| Destination in adjacent ward           | 3d6 × 5 minutes |
| Destination farther than adjacent ward | 6d6 × 5 minutes |
| Flying Travel                          |                 |
| Destination in same district           | 1d6 minutes     |
| Destination in same ward               | 2d6 minutes     |
| Destination in adjacent ward           | 1d6 × 5 minutes |
| Destination farther than adjacent ward | 2d6 × 5 minutes |

- A party can reduce this time by one-half if one character makes a successful DC 15 investigation 

- Numbers in parentheses are for magebred horses with the swift breed special quality

### Shavalant



## Description
> Nestled along a winding dirt road, just south of Lake Galifar, lies a quaint village. As you approach, you notice the rhythmic clinking of tools and the soft murmur of voices emanating from small shops and houses clustered together. A few houses are blackened and charred, and seemed to have partially collapsed. The buildings themselves are worn but well-kept, surrounded by fields of crops, some of which are parsley scattered with workers. The air carries the earthy scent of tilled soil and fresh produce. A large metal water tower stands out like a soar thumb, its network of magical pipes extending from the tower into the ground. If you hold your breath, you can almost hear a low-pitched hum emanating from the thing.

###### Texts.
*"Ancient Clay Tablets"*
	...and so it came to pass that the Couatl, in their ultimate act of selflessness, bound the Overlord Rak Tulkhesh within the depths of Khyber. His rage, once a tempest that threatened to consume the world, was contained within a prison of their own making. The land trembled as his prison was forged, and the echoes of his fury were silenced for an age.

*Artifacts of the First Age"*
	"...Among the relics of the bygone era, few hold the mystique and power of Etherseraph, the White Flame Blade. Its origins shrouded in myth and legend, this ethereal weapon is said to have been wielded by champions of light in the age before the Church of the Silver Flame. Forged from the very essence of celestial fire, Etherseraph is more than just a blade; it is a conduit of divine energy, capable of banishing darkness and vanquishing evil. Legends speak of its ability to cleave through the fabric of reality, opening pathways to other realms and dimensions. Though its whereabouts remain unknown, the tales of Etherseraph continue to inspire awe and wonder, a testament to the enduring power of light in the face of darkness..."

*"The Chronicles of the Silver Flame"*
    "In the darkest hour, when all hope seemed lost, the couatls made the ultimate sacrifice. Their essence merged, forming a beacon of pure light - the Silver Flame. Its radiance pierced the darkness, driving back the forces of evil and offering solace to the righteous."

*"On the Ethereal Chains: The Pursuit of Life Beyond Death"*
	"The quest for immortality often leads down a path shadowed by ethereal chains. Ancient scholars posited the existence of a soul's anchor—a phylactery—yet, warned of its tether to undeath. A new school of thought, however, seeks the dawn beyond this twilight. Imagine an ethereal crucible, not for ensnaring the soul in a cycle of undeath, but as a bastion for the living essence. A vessel, perhaps, that might harbor the spark of life eternal, untainted by necrosis. Such are the whispers of alchemists and arcanists alike, dreaming of a future where life knows no end."

*"~~Khyber's Darkness: A Study of the Draconic Prophecy~~"*
    "The fragments of ~~Khyber~~, born ~~from the Dragon Below~~, hold untold power. When ~~united~~ they have the potential to unleash great ~~darkness~~ upon the world. The Draconic ~~Prophecy speaks~~ of a time when the fragments shall align, and the forces of ~~shadow~~ will rise once more."

*"The Argent Grimoire: Teachings of the Silver Flame"*
    "Those who follow the path of the Silver Flame must embody its virtues: courage, sacrifice, and unwavering devotion. Through faith and righteous action, the followers of the Flame become beacons of hope in a world beset by darkness. Their magic, fueled by the Flame's radiance, is a potent weapon against the forces of evil."

*"The Shattered Shard: An Account of the Last War"*
     "During the Last War, the nations of Khorvaire clashed in a brutal conflict that reshaped the face of the continent. Amidst the chaos, a great cataclysm struck: the Mourning. The once-mighty nation of Cyre was consumed by a mysterious mist, leaving only the blasted wasteland now known as the Mournland. The cause of this tragedy remains unknown, but rumors persist of dark magic and forbidden experiments gone awry."

*"The Annals of House Cannith"*
    "House Cannith, bearer of the Mark of Making, has long been at the forefront of arcane innovation. Their creations, from the majestic warforged to the convenience of the Everbright lantern, have shaped the course of history.

*"The Flame's Sacrifice: A Martyr's Tale"*
    "Tira Miron, a paladin of the Silver Flame, faced a terrible choice. To save the world from a great evil, she willingly offered herself as a vessel for the Flame's power. In a blinding flash of radiance, Tira ascended, becoming one with the Silver Flame. Her sacrifice stands as a testament to the depths of devotion and the unyielding spirit of those who serve the Flame."

### The Shadow's Cradle


AKA ***The Tower of Old***

**Backstory:** This dilapidated, hidden underground tower is surrounded by boiling pools of lava deep below Sharn. Difficult to find, the Shadow's Cradle is far from comforting. Its origin unknown, it was gifted to Woe by his master Mordakhesh as a place to recover and develop his newfound abilities.

### Woe's Journal Entries:

*Moral Questions*
> Mordakhesh speaks of liberation, of breaking the chains that bind us. But what if these new chains are just as strong, just as suffocating? What if this power consumes me, turns me into the very weapon I was built to be?

*Determination*
> I must understand this gift, this curse. I must find my own path, forge my own destiny. For I am no longer just a soldier, no longer just a tool. He shed from me my prison of blood and flesh and made me anew. I am Woe, and I will not be controlled.

*Purpose*
> The orders barked, the battles fought, the endless cycle of war. Was that truly purpose? Or just another form of slavery?

*Greater Good*
> Was it truly for the greater good, or was it just blind obedience to a flawed system?

*You killed them*
> Choosing to sacrifice another man isn't an act of valor or righteousness. It is a shadowed deed, veiled in the guise of necessity, yet it remains nothing less than murder. You killed them. You killed me. You killed us all.

### The Temple of the Endless Rage


# Concept (pg. 143)
- Over 100,000 years ago, at the end of the age of demons, the Couatl made their sacrifice and separated the [[Overlords]]' source of power from the material plane, weakening and trapping their avatars in magical prisons around the world. 
- This is the prison of **[[Rak Tulkesh|Rak Tulkesh's]]** power, which is useless without an avatar.

# Description
> As you step past the stone columns that mark the entrance, the world behind you fades away, replaced by a hushed reverence for something incomprehensibly ancient. The air here is warm, and as it feels like pine needles as it rushes past you. It smells of wet stone and dank moss. 

>  A bright, silver fire emanates from a pulsing purple gem, illuminating the temple from the far side of you, casting you in dim light. Thick columns of cracked marble line this place in multiple rows, acting as supports that hold up the vaulted ceiling. Many runes have been chiseled out of the columns, but the wear of time has made them almost completely unreadable. All you can make out is "Temple - Endless - Rage".

> Rows of well kept wooden pews line both sides of a walkway that leads to the flame. As you take in the vastness of this temple, its centerpiece demands your attention. An enormous pit sits 15ft in front of you. Its depth so vast and dark it swallows any light that dare enter it.

> It has a sort of alluring pull to it that gets stronger the closer you get. Almost as if its calling to you, reaching out to your very soul with a single word... "CLOSER".

# Notable Locations
- The Endless: The pit that sits in the middle of this timeless temple is actually the largest entrance to *Shavarath*, the demiplane of **Rak Tulkesh**. Though its not large enough to allow the return of his Avatar, it still exudes an immensely powerful influence over the land nearby.

# Story

## All Arcs


## Arc Setup
Story arcs are set up in a very specific way that is shown below. The idea is that at least one of these arcs is being moved forward every session. This is combined with a more extensive plot web to create a  cohesive and intuitive narrative experience for the players.

If a list under an Arc is numbered, this represents the order of priority, not necessarily the order it will be completed. The plot points towards the top of each list are more significant, while the ones towards the bottom may be less significant to the main plot, and more prone to being changed or discarded.

Each arc has a "completion point" which indicates when that arc will be wrapped up and the next one will begin.

Arcs do not have to be completed in any particular order, and many immediate arcs may be completed before a narrative arc is completed (or even before it becomes the main focus).

##### Immediate Arc
- This is what the players are attempting to accomplish at this moment or in the immediate future.
- Each is generally wrapped up within a few sessions
- Generally can be extrapolated from sub-plots of narrative arcs
- Thought of in terms of short-term, obvious, and achievable goals, like episodes of a TV show
	- Ex.: *Obtain horses to improve travel on the long roads ahead*
	- Ex. 2: *Assist an apothecary that you encountered on your journey*

##### Narrative Arc
- This is what the collective immediate arcs are building towards
- Each is generally wrapped up with their own satisfying and self-contained storylines
- Thought of in terms of seasons of a TV show. Goals are more long-term and may not be immediately obvious to PCs
	- Ex.: *Safely travel around the nation and make it to the City of Towers*
	- Ex. 2: *Figure out why tensions are high in Sharn and fix it.*

##### Campaign Arc
- The overall theme or main arc of the entire campaign
- Built up to by each narrative arc, becoming more obvious as the game goes on
- Completion of this arc marks the end of the campaign
- Should provide a satisfying ending that involves the culmination of everything the PCs have accomplished so far
	- Ex.: *The final fight with the ultimate BBEG*

## Narrative Plot Overview


In the land of Eberron, the balance of power teeters on the brink of chaos. The Silver Flame, a mystical force that has safeguarded the realm for centuries, is missing and slowly burning out. This disappearance, coupled with the threat of the Lords of Dust attempting to free the Overlord Rak Tulkesh, casts a shadow of impending doom across the world. Amidst this turmoil, a group of unlikely heroes emerges, their destinies intertwined by fate and their shared quest to protect their world.

### The Heroes

**Bjorn "Bearwolf" Ulfr**, a proud warrior from the Stormpeak Clan, finds his life shattered when his brother Hrothgar, tainted by a dark dragonshard, usurps his rule. Hrothgar’s corruption plunges their homeland into darkness, forcing Bjorn to gather a new group of allies, united by shared ideals and a common enemy.

**Draven Flameforge**, once known as the Knight of the North, is a legend reborn. Hailing from the Flameforge Clan in the Byeshk Mountains, Draven was trained by Varyn the Valiant, the last of the Couatls. Varyn, burdened by regret and self-doubt, sacrificed much of his remaining power to resurrect Draven after he was killed by Hrothgar. Now, Draven, devoid of his past memories, carries the weight of Varyn’s hopes and the light of Siberys, seeking to hold back the forces of Khyber.

**Geralt Wolfsbane** lives on the edge of civilization near the Whitehorn Woods, haunted by the loss of his parents, who were once brilliant artificers of House Cannith. They fled the House to protect their revolutionary design, the Steelhardt, from being misused. Geralt, driven by a mysterious page covered in ancient Sibernyan runes, seeks to unlock its secrets and uncover the truth about his parents’ work.

**Forge**, the first successful soul-transferred Warforged, is an enigma. Created using the souls of fallen soldiers and an unprecedented balance of Siberys and Khyber aspects, Forge retained his memories and sanity. After escaping House Cannith’s control, he destroyed his creation forge and now carries vital knowledge about the Warforged’s true nature. Hunted by his creators, Forge grapples with the ethical implications of his existence and the potential to create more like himself.

### The Villains

**Vorak**, once a loyal assassin of House Cannith, underwent a dark transformation through the Steelhardt. His failed transfer left him a creature of pure rage, manipulated by Mordakhesh, a lieutenant of Rak Tulkesh. Now, Vorak roams the land, his existence tied to the suffering and rage of those he destroys, perpetuating a cycle of death and resurrection.

**Woe**, a soldier from the Last War, was resurrected by Mordakhesh using a fragment of the Fractured Khyber Dragonshard. Now a Warforged infused with dark power, Woe seeks to reunite the shards, believing it will liberate his new race and exact revenge on those who wronged him.

**Mordakhesh** himself is the architect behind many of the heroes’ woes. As a loyal servant of Rak Tulkesh, he guides Woe and others in a relentless quest to free his master. His manipulations are subtle, his motives shrouded in secrecy, making him a dangerous adversary.

**Hrothgar**, Bjorn’s corrupted brother, wields dark power that plagues the land. His possession of a dragonshard fragment and the Etherseraph, a powerful artifact, has turned him into a formidable foe, threatening the very fabric of their homeland.

### Artifacts of Power

The **Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD)** contains the essence of Rak Tulkesh. Scattered in fragments, it grants immense power to those tainted by its dark influence. Woe, Professor Baelen ir'Torn, and Hrothgar each hold fragments, their fates intertwined by the shard’s corrupting touch.

The **Etherseraph**, crafted by Varyn, is both a weapon and a guide. Its white flame has the power to clear the Mourning’s fog and reveal the path to the Silver Flame’s hidden sanctuary. Once wielded by heroes like Tira Miron and Draven, it now lies in the hands of Hrothgar.

The **Steelhardt**, originally designed by Geralt’s parents, can transfer a soul into a new body, promising immortality. However, without the balance of Siberys, Khyber, and Eberron’s aspects, its use results in madness. The Lords of Dust seek to use it to free Rak Tulkesh, making it a central piece in the unfolding drama.

### Factions and Intrigue

**House Cannith**, led by Marix d'Cannith, is steeped in secrets and dark experiments. Their involvement in the creation of Warforged and the Day of Mourning positions them as a pivotal player in the world’s fate.

The **Church of the Silver Flame**, desperate to locate the missing Silver Flame, collaborates with Baelen ir'Torn to harness the power of the dragonshard fragments. Unaware of the Flame’s true location, their quest is fraught with peril and deception.

The **Boromar Clan**, driven by greed and the promise of power, pursues the dragonshard fragments with relentless ambition. Their actions add another layer of complexity to the already tangled web of intrigue.

### Themes and Questions

As the heroes navigate their quests, they grapple with profound questions about morality, redemption, and the nature of evil. Can those born into darkness find their way to the light? What does it take to redeem oneself after a great failure? Through their struggles, they uncover that most villains are not purely evil but shaped by their justifications and past traumas.

The world of Eberron stands on the edge of a knife. The heroes must forge their paths, facing inner demons and external threats, to protect what remains of the Silver Flame and prevent the release of an ancient evil. Their intertwined destinies and the choices they make will determine the fate of their world.

#### PC: Geralt Wolfsbane
- Yelena & Norbit Wolfsbane
	- Geralt's mother and father
	- Wolfsbane is Norbit's family name
	- They both adopted the d'Cannith name, then later gave it up after they left the house.
- Parents died when he was young
	- Killed by Vorak (prior to transformation) as ordered by Marix d'Cannith.
- Geralt's parents originally created the first designs of the Steelhardt while they were a part of House Cannith
	- It was originally intended to be a way of transferring one's "soul" to a new body, effectively producing immortality.
		- The consciousness was attached to the Steelhardt in a magical ritual
		- It then had to be implanted into a corpse for the consciousness to then take over.
		- They created one prototype, combining a Khyber & Siberys shard in the device
		- It was fully functional as intended, but they never wrote down how they got those two shards to work together.
		- Cannith Artificer's subsequent attempts to combine the shards in new designs always failed.
	- They worked for years refining the designs.
	- Marix, working with the LoD, took an interest in these designs for use in creating a sentient warforged army.
		- Yelena and Norbit found out about Marix's plans and fled House Cannith with all of the designs, hiding with their young son near the Whitehorn Woods.
- Geralt was snooping in his father's office when he found the designs laid out across his desk.
		- Being unable to read them, he stole a page that had 'cool' designs and runes on it, also bearing the Gorgon seal of House Cannith.
		- He still has this page to this day.
		- A part of why he has learnt so many languages was to decode this page, but he was never able to.
			- It is written in an ancient language that his parents spoke, due to their inherent secrecy (**Sibernyan**)
			- Language was prominently spoken by the Couatl.
- One night his parents were murdered in their home by Vorak, who stole the prototype schematics. 
- When his parents were killed, he escaped and fled into the woods. He was about 12. He learned to live off the land and was able to survive.
- He now lives near Shavalant and the Whitehorn Woods.

#### PC: Forge
- Forge was created in the first batch of modern warforged - and the only one that didn't lose his mind due to his new found form. All others in his creation batch either ended their own existence or were terminated. Artificers were unable to identify and replicate what traits allowed Forge to retain both his memories and his sanity.
	- The missing traits being: The soul being transferred MUST have aspects of Khyber & aspects of Siberys fused to the soul to transfer without sanity loss.
	- Forge's Steelhardt used Siberys shards as a conduit. In all other warforged in his batch, only having a Siberys shard wasn't enough, since there was no aspect of Khyber attached to their soul/in the Steelhardt.
	- Hence why Vorak's transfer was tainted as well. His Steelhardt used a Khyber shard conduit, but there was no aspect of Siberys attached to him.
	- Since Forge died in proximity to Lick's father's FKD fragment, an aspect of Khyber attached to his soul, which, in addition to the Siberys Dragonshard conduit in his Steelhardt, meant he retained his memories AND his sanity.
	- This information about the missing traits is not currently known **(Vorak stole most of the schematics, which were scattered in various locations for future quests)
- All subsequent batches were made with these methods, using the souls of dead soldiers, however they were stripped of their mortal memories. This was the only work-around House Cannith could devise to prevent these new Warforged from losing their minds.
- Forge was a human general of **House Cannith (Or maybe some other affiliation makes more sense?)**
- In a battle during the last war, he sacrificed his and his men's lives in an explosion he set off to overtake the enemy.
	- Lick's father and Woe were in Forge's squad. Forge valued winning the battle/war over the lives of his own men. While Woe and Lick's father were engaged in battle, Forge made the decision to sacrifice himself and his entire squad to blow up and destroy the **target (what was the target/what was this battle being fought for?)**.
	- Woe died close to Lick's father's fragment of the *FKD*, causing an aspect of Khyber to latch onto his soul which allowed him to be resurrected into a Warforged body through Mordakhesh's ritual (more details in Woe's backstory)
- Forge's soul was captured by House Cannith and infused into a warforged body. He was held prisoner and used for various tests and experiments for a period of time.
- Near the end of the war, he broke free and, using his skills from his past life, **destroyed his creation forge**.
	- He obtained information on his creation, including the methods that were still being used to create new warforged.
	- **He threatened to go public with that [[forge knowledge handout|info]]? (Knowing he would be unable to destroy all of the forges on his own, he forced House Cannith's hand into signing the Treaty of Thronehold and shutting down all creation forges, ending the production of new Warforged?)(Maybe he didn't go public because in the back of his mind he knew one day he may want to "have children"? See 'character motivation'.** 
- Warforged were not liberated due to the Treaty of Thronehold. This treaty was a political move so that Forge would not go public with the information he holds on Warforged production and ruin House Cannith's reputation.
- Due to the ever-looming threat of blackmail, House Cannith has been hunting Forge ever since his escape, attempting to **capture him for further study (probably to continue to attempt to replicate the traits that allowed him to keep his memories)** and eliminate the possibility of that information ever getting out.
- He was branded with a unique dragonmark on the front of this chest. It contains the House Cannith Gorgan, in addition to markings that read "FORGE 2".
- He learned of **another creation forge in Sharn (How did he find out?)**, explaining his presence outside the lighthouse during his introduction to the campaign in session 5, because he was looking for the teleportation circle inside The Lighthouse.
- ***Character motivation:***
	- Is it unethical to create more in my image? Does that make me a God, or does that make me one of you (normal people)?
#### PC: Sylas Stormshadow (Deceased)
- Father was an Elven scholar focused on forbidden knowledge about magic
- Mother was a human merchant in Sharn's Underbelly
- Learned of eldritch power through his father
- Made a pact w/ the Traveler in the sewers
- Would be randomly taken to a different plane for the Traveler's duties
## Story Plot Pieces
- **Themes**:
	- What makes a person good? 
	- Most villains aren't purely evil, but have their own justifications.
	- What does it take to redeem oneself of a great failure? When does one become irredeemable?
	- If one has only known evil since birth, are they redeemable or can they overcome that nature? 

- **Central Tension**: The Silver Flame is missing, the Lords of Dust are trying to free Rak Tulkesh
	- ***Plot Secret***: The Mourning was caused by the Silver Flame itself. 
		- Originally located in Cyre, it was discovered by the Lords of Dust and almost destroyed
		- The silver flame caused the Mourning to protect itself, but used most of its power doing so
		- Slowly burning out, Overlords are straining against their bonds, causing chaos across the world

- **Significant Lore**: The Origin of the Warforged
	- Warforged are the man-made reincarnates of the fallen soldiers in the Last War; Their souls were repurposed as weapons in the war that took their lives once already.
	- The first few batches of Warforged were created without a 'soul' - mindless automatons that had no self initiative or instinct. They were grunts, they followed orders, but on average they were less effective than a typical soldier.
	- Cannith artificers - at the order of Marix d'Cannith - devised a method of transferring the soul of a recently deceased humanoid into the body of a warforged - building on the original *Steelhardt* designs taken from Geralt's parents.

- **Significant NPCs**
	- Varyn "The Valiant" Grayburn
		- ***Major Regret:*** Varyn feels as though he has never done anything right, and all of his actions have only diminished the sacrifice his kind made.
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To protect the world against the Overlords, and become worthy of calling himself a Couatl
		- Last remaining Couatl, was too scared to sacrifice himself for the Silver Flame
		- Takes the form of an old man missing his left arm at the shoulder. His true form has a partially missing left wing.
		- Formed Clan Flameforge to keep watch on the Overlords and their prisons
			- Directly oppose actions of the Lords of Dust
			- A small group within felt that Clan Flameforge's scope was too narrow.
			- They branched off and formed the Church of the Silver Flame.
		- Varyn felt the increasing forces of the LoD that were fighting to release their Overlords.
			- He grew fearful that they would learn about the Dragonshard that kept Rak Tulkesh imprisoned.
			- Knowing of their existence but not their location, he began a search that spanned many decades. He finally found a single fragment.
			- The LoD found out and also began a search.
			- After learning that his efforts alerted the LoD to the existence of the Shards, he lost hope, and was immensely disappointed in himself.
			- During a blizzard of a cliffside in the mountains, just as he was going to end his existence, Bjorn's father Kvitrafn found him.
		- After seeing the fragment's effect on Hrothgar, Varyn left the Stormpeak clan and returned to Clan Flameforge to find a young Draven.
		- He saw the purity and potential within Draven
			- The darkness within the shard never affected him.
		- Seeing Draven as an ultimate force for good, he gave him two things:
			- The *Etherseraph*
			- A *FKD* fragment
		- Draven took an Oath to protect the Shard with his life, and to use the light of Siberys to hold back the forces of Khyber

	- Aeren d'Cannith
		- ***Major Motivation:*** To discover the true process of the creation of Warforged and what changed between  the originals and the modern creations.
		- Was adopted into House Cannith about 20 years ago at the age of 18 y/o as the Youngest Master Artificer (and only Master Artificer without a Mark of Creation) ever named within the house.
			- Due to his invention of the ingenious Everbright Lantern
		- He is now the Mentor to Miri, the magewright currently living in Shavelant.
		- He was always very interested in the warforged and their creation.
		- Aeren knew of Geralt's parents before they died, and knew they were very important.
			- He didn't know what they were researching, but he knew it was highly classified.
		- He does not know what Geralt's schematics say, but he knows that they were written in an ancient draconic dialect (**Sibernyan**)
		- He has come across a few pages of his own **(figure to what those pages reveal?)** but has not been able to translate them.

**Artifacts**
- Artifact 1: ***Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD) & Fragments***
	- Their existence was kept a closely guarded secret by Varyn.
		- Mordakesh and his followers eventually learned of their location, and have been hunting them down since.
		- Varyn was followed when he began searching for them. He found the first fragment, but tipped the LoD off to the others.
	- Contains imprisoned essence of Rak Tulkesh
	- Grants user powers if their soul is tainted
	- Who has them
		- Woe: main shard + 1 fragment (taken from Lick in session 1)
		- Professor Baelen ir'Torn: 1 fragment (Needs development, where/how did he find it?)
		- Hrothgar: 1 fragment, obtained from Draven when Hrothgar battled and killed him

- Artifact 2: ***Etherseraph***
	- The Etherseraph was crafted by Varyn following the Silver Flame's creation.
	- In addition to a powerful weapon, the Etherseraph is a tool:
		- The white flame of the Etherseraph will clear the fog of the Mourning and light the way to the Gate of the Silver Flame.
		- The Gate is the entrance to the pocket dimension that contains the actual Silver Flame.
	- Over the years, Varyn has gifted it to many people he deemed worthy to carry it, the most notable being Tira Miron, who, years ago, used it to reseal an escaped Overlord and become the Voice of the Silver Flame.
	- Draven Flameforge was another that was trained by Varyn, and gifted the Etherseraph to wield in the name of Siberys.
	- It is now in Hrothgar's possession, obtained when he killed Draven in battle.

- Artifact 3: ***Steelhardt (The Prototype)***
	- Originally developed by Geralt's Parents as a device that could transfer consciousness to a corpse, producing immortality.
	- Geralt's parent knew that the transference would only be successful if balance between all 3 *Aspects of the Progenitors* were maintained.
		- **Siberys's aspect:** Light, Divinity
		- **Khyber's aspect:** Darkness, Impiety
		- **Eberron's aspect:** Materialism, Tangibility
	- Any imbalance of these 3 (like only using a Khyber/Siberys shard without the other) would result in an imbalance of the soul, causing psychosis.
	- Yelena and Norbit created a single prototype that worked fully as intended. They combined Siberys and Khyber dragonshards into the device, which allowed those two aspects to be fulfilled.
		- They never wrote down how they manage to combine those two shards into a single device. All other attempts made by Cannith Artificers have always failed, and only one shard can be installed without the device failing, which has caused psychosis in almost all subjects it was originally attempted on.
		- Cannith artificers developed a work-around to the psychosis issue: They wipe the soul's memories upon transference to the Warforged body.
	- The LoD seek to use a Steelhardt to transfer Rak Tulkesh's essence from the FKD into a living avatar, so that he could be freed from his bonds and reign over Eberron once again (See Woe's plot pieces).

- **Villains**
	- Vorak
		- Vorak was House Cannith's most skilled assassin, loyal to the House for most of his life. Originally a half-elf, he served for over a hundred years until his age forced him out of field work, though he remained a top advisor for covert activities within the House.
		- He was sent by Marix d'Cannith to kill Geralt's parents after they fled House Cannith.
		- Voluntarily underwent House Cannith's and the Wolfsbane's very first attempt at using a Steelhardt to transfer a soul to another body.
		- The transfer was successful, moving Vorak from his original body to a younger, stronger one from a random deceased soldier.
		- While he retained his memories, his mind quickly became plagued with dark thoughts, his grip on reality worsening.
		- He went rogue, and was manipulated by Mordakhesh, who focused Vorak's mind to one objective: destroy the Silver Flame.
		- Bolstered by new dark powers infused into his Steelhardt by Mordakesh, he led the forces of the LoD in their attack against the Silver Flame on the Day of Mourning.
			- His attempt to destroy the Silver Flame failed and rebounded, turning him into a rage-fueled creature of destruction, and allowing the Silver Flame to defend itself by causing the Mourning.
		- Now he roams the land, destroying villages, feeding off the rage of the survivors, and using it to resurrect himself should he fall in battle. He is fed imaged in his mind by Mordakhesh to keep him focused on attacking his targets.
		- His darkness-infused Steelhardt causes him to achieve quasi-lichdom through unique means:
			- Should his body ever die, his soul will be kept safe in his Steelhardt until it is placed into a new body.
			- The survivors of his onslaughts get the unrelenting urge to find Vorak and kill him, but if Vorak is dead they find the Steelhardt instead.
			- Once one of the survivors finds his Steehardt, rage consumes them, and forces them to plunge the artifact into their own chest, killing them, and allowing Vorak to resurrect through their body.
			- This process can only be stopped through a ritual involving a Siberys Dragonshard

	- Woe
		- Was originally a human soldier fighting in the Last war under his commanding officer, Forge.
		- During a battle, he was locked into a duel with Lick's father, who wore a fragment of the *FKD* around his neck.
		- During this duel, Forge set off an explosion that completed their objective, but also killed Forge, Woe, Lick's father, and most others that were involved in this battle.
		- Woe's proximity to the fragment of the *FKD* during his death caused his soul to be tainted, keeping him in 'Limbo' after death.
		- Mordakhesh - led by the Draconic Prophecy - resurrected Woe in a profane ritual that stored his soul into the *FKD*, fusing it with the essence of Rak Tulkesh, and containing it in a Warforged body.
		- This gave him dark powers, sourced from Rak Tulkesh's essence, which is trapped within. The only limit to his power being the remaining FKD fragments that are still out in the world.
		- Woe's soul, now heavily influenced by the Overlord of Rage, works fanatically under Mordakhesh's guidance.
		- ***Motivation:***
			- Forge's decision to sacrifice himself and all of his men, including Woe, caused Woe to become extremely tribal, going to extreme means to protect any he deems as 'his people', and to destroy any who he perceives as threatening their existence.
			- He seeks to reunite all of the *FKD* fragments and use that power to liberate his newfound race of Warforged, and wipe all who oppose him from the planet.

	- Mordakhesh
		- Lieutenant to Rak Tulkhesh
		- Commands the Lords of Dust & performed ritual on Woe
		- Has been hunting the FKD fragments for a long time
			- Ever since Varyn went looking for them
		- Has been guiding Woe to seek out the *FKD* fragments, telling him they will give him the power to achieve his own goals
		- Mardakhesh has kept a secret from Woe - the reunification of the FKD and its shards will allow Rak Tulkesh to use Woe's soul as a catalyst - destroying Rak Tulkesh's prison and allowing his avatar to once again claim dominion over Eberron, shattering Woe's soul in the process.

	- Hrothgar 
		- Bjorn's brother
		- Usurped Bjorn's position as the Chieftian of the Stormpeak Clan
		- Killed Draven and took his fractured dragonshard fragment and white flameblade, further increasing his power and dark influence on the surrounding land.

- **Factions**
	- House Cannith
		- The leader of Cannith south is Marix d'Cannith.
		- Marix ordered the use of the Steelhardt in the ritual involving Vorack.
		- He also put the hit out on Geralt's parents.

	- Church of the Silver Flame
		- ***Secret***: Doesn't actually know where the Silver Flame is kept.
		- ***Motivation:*** Find the Silver Flame and claim dominion over it, to protect it.
		- Know of the Boromar Clan's attempts to track down Baelin ir'Torn for the dragonshard fragment.
		- Are working with Baelen trying to locate the Silver Flame, giving him their resources.

	- Boromar clan
		- Seeks the Dragonshard and fragments for none other than the promise of wealth and power
		- Have been tracking Baelen ir'Torn

### Arrival at Sharn


**Via lightning rail at Terminus Station.**
As you step off the lightning rail coach, the cacophony of Terminus Station washes over you. The air hums with the energy of a thousand voices, all clamoring, bartering, and calling out greetings or farewells. The station itself is a colossal structure, its high, vaulted ceiling supported by thick columns of dark, polished wood. Enormous everbright lanterns hang from the ceiling, bathing the station in a warm, welcoming glow.

Before you can even take a breath, you're surrounded by a swarm of people. Porters push their way through the throng, their carts piled high with luggage and crates. Skycoach drivers tout the speed and comfort of their vehicles, hoping to lure travelers to their flying chariots. Guides, their faces eager and hopeful, offer their services to help navigate the labyrinthine city. And of course, there are the inevitable beggars, their pleas for alms blending into the general din.

Through the crowd, you can see the many shops and stalls that line the edges of the station. House Orien maintains a strong presence here, with offices for arranging transport and shipping, as well as a small enclave for its heirs. House Sivis has a message station here, and House Deneith has a small outpost where you can hire bodyguards or laborers. House Vadalis even operates a large stable and hostelry, should you need to secure your mounts while exploring the city.

**Via land road at Wroann's Gate.**
As you approach the colossal entrance to the City of Towers, you begin to understand the depth of its name. A breathtaking panorama of soaring spires and towering structures stretches before you, reaching up into the sky as if to pierce the heavens themselves. The sheer scale of the city is overwhelming, and you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder.

The gate itself is a marvel of engineering, a massive archway carved from black granite and topped by a titanic statue of Queen Wroann of Breland. The queen holds a scepter in one hand and a sword above her head.

The streets of Wroann's Gate teem with life. Merchants and traders hawk their wares, their voices blending into a cacophony of sound. Travelers from across Khorvaire mingle with the city's residents, their faces reflecting a myriad of cultures and backgrounds. Skycoaches flit through the air like giant dragonflies, carrying passengers to their destinations. And beneath it all, you can hear the constant hum of the Cogs, the beating heart of Sharn's industry.

Crossing the threshold into the impossibly tall city, the first thing that hits you is the smell. It's a complex, ever-shifting blend of a thousand different scents: the tang of smoke and sulfur from the Cogs, the sweet aroma of exotic spices, the stench of sewage and garbage, and the faint but unmistakable fragrance of magic.

The next thing you notice is the noise. Sharn is a city that never sleeps, and the din of its inhabitants is constant. You hear the shouts of merchants hawking their wares, the clatter of hooves on cobblestones, the rhythmic clang of hammers in the Cogs, and the distant roar of the crowds in the entertainment districts. It's a noise that can be overwhelming at first, but it's also a noise that pulsates with life and energy.

You're struck by the diversity of the city's inhabitants. Humans, dwarves, elves, halflings, gnomes, and even more exotic creatures all rub shoulders in the crowded streets. You see merchants from the Lhazaar Principalities haggling with traders from the Mror Holds. You see warforged laborers hauling goods alongside halfling teamsters. You see goblin families begging for alms, their faces etched with the hardship of life in the lower wards.

### Its Kismet


### Its Kismet
**Kismet** is one of the personas of ***The Traveler***, the first hag to walk upon Eberron, born of the Age of Demons. Being the first, Kismet is so powerful her effect on the land is now worshipped as godhood. 

Kismet presents herself as a frazzled old half-elf woman, with a weak frame and loose skin. She claims her wagon, which is seen filled with various trade goods, lost a wheel, and that she needs help repairing it so she may continue her journey.

She claims to be a seer, and offers her services in exchange for help.

### Reading of Fate

Bjorn's reading
>  Ahh, the Bearwolf. The storm within you rages, your heart torn between duty and blood. Yes, I feel your fury, one that is matched only by the darkness that taints your brother's soul. And in the tidal forces of your anger lies a riptide of betrayal, confusion, and... grief. In time, he will know your pain, and your anger will be his fuel, for your destiny was forged in flame and storm long ago.

Draven's reading:
> A knight of many names, and yet you've barely begun to rediscover what any of them mean to you. The Knight's own mind betrays him, a Valiant sacrifice your curse and your savior. Your mind is shrouded in mist, your memories hidden to you. Its barely perceivable, but you know something is very wrong. Its as if a subtle noise that was comforting your ear has suddenly been snuffed out, its absence your only hint at its presence. Will the light of Siberys grant you divine clarity? Or has it already killed the knight, his body not yet informed?

Geralt's reading:
> The lost child, a wolf born of oak and stone, bird song and a quiet breeze your comfort, your solace, a second home created out of the destruction of another. The creations of man have ripped so much from you. Yes... I feel anger and disgust. But is it born only from what has been taken from you? Or is part of it from knowing, deep down, that your only chance of discovering why you lost everything lies in the story of your family's still-beating heart?

- This is a faction of Kobolds that worship [[Tiamat]], called the [[Sons of the Daughter of Khyber]]

## Encounters
### Dialogue between 2 kobolds
**Nasally Kobold**: "Hey, did you see Brains? He all twitchy and scribbling again."

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Yeah, he mad 'bout the last bunch. Not right for the big wake-up thing. He say Woe trick us."

**Nasally Kobold**: "He keep saying 'need willing ones.' What that mean? We just grab what Woe give, right?"

**Deep, Scarred Kobold**: "Shh! Don't let Brains hear ya. He think he big thinker, say he got plan. But some say he not know anything."

**Nasally Kobold**: "Bah, just want big fire and boom like in prophecy. Brains better be right, or maybe we find new boss, huh?"
### Brain's mutterances
- "No, no, no... not right, not right. Woe said willing... where find willing? Stupid, stupid!"
- "Prophecy say... blood of willing. But these not willing. Why not work? Brains think, think... must be answer."
- "Others whisper, whisper behind Brains. They think Brains not know... but Brains smartest! Must show them, must prove!"
- "If not get right one, all bad. All bad for Brains. Others get angry, maybe want new leader. No, no, can't let that happen."
## Enemy goals
- Want to summon [[Argonnessen#Secrets|The Daughter of Khyber]] by doing a ritual sacrifice of a "*Willing Dragon Kin*".
	- They misinterpreted this as any Dragonborn/Kobolds, not a willing dragon that has to sacrifice itself.
- This sacrifice is a mistaken ancient take on a part of the [[Draconic Prophecy]] that states if a willing dragon kin is sacrificed in a very particular set of circumstances, The Daughter of Khyber will be freed.

### Prophecy Fragment concerning Tiamat
> In the hour when shadows grow long and the moon bleeds its light, the Daughter of Khyber shall stir in her dark slumber. Only then, if the kin of dragons, willing in heart and spirit, offers itself unto the void, shall the chains of the Daughter weaken. Her roar shall echo through the Five Sorrows, and the world shall tremble before her awakening.

### Ritual in the Kogs


Location: [[Kogs Ritual Chamber]]

**Ritual Completion and Dismissal by Mordakhesh**:

- As the ritual concludes, the air thick with arcane energy, Mordakhesh steps back from the altar. He observes Woe, who is still recovering from the procedure. With a slight tone of concern mixed with command, Mordakhesh advises, "Rest now, let the shard’s essence meld with your own. But first, dispose of our uninvited guests." This comment is made dismissively, without even a glance at the party, underscoring their perceived insignificance.

**Woe's Awakening**:

- Woe lethargically sits up, his eyes flashing with newly imbued purple energy. He lazily stretches a hand towards a dormant piece of machinery nearby. As his fingers twitch, a burst of purple energy flows from his hand into the machine, which whirs to life, its mechanical eyes glowing with the same ominous purple.
- He watches with mild interest, a slight smirk on his face, as the machine turns towards the party, ready to attack.

**Combat Dynamics**:

- The enchanted machine, powered by the dragonshard’s essence, aggressively targets the party. Describe the machine’s movements as unnaturally swift and powerful, enhanced by the magical energy.
- Throughout the fight, as the party manages to damage the machine, Woe, with minimal effort, could casually redirect his energy to enchant other machinery in the room to join the fray, each time causing the cavern to rumble ominously.

**Environmental Collapse and Escape Routes**:

- The ongoing battle and the unstable arcane energy cause the cavern to shake violently. Debris falls, blocking the path they originally took while conveniently opening up another route that leads deeper into the maze of the Kogs and possibly exits near an unexpected part of Sharn.
- As the party battles or decides to flee, they notice the structural integrity of the cavern degrading, hinting that staying much longer could be fatal.

**The Magic’s Limit and Woe's Disinterest**:

- If the party manages to distance themselves from the animated machinery, perhaps through clever maneuvering or by making a dash for the new escape route, they'll notice the purple energy begins to fade from the machines, causing them to slow and eventually stop, unable to pursue further.
- Woe assumes the machines have dealt with the party or that they are no longer his problem. He dismisses them from his mind and exits via his own means, perhaps a portal or cloaked in a shroud of shadows, to recover from the ritual’s exertions.

### Conclusion and Aftermath:

- Once safe, the party can regroup and process the sheer power and threat Woe represents. This encounter not only sets up Woe as a formidable foe but also deepens the mystery and danger of what he and Mordakhesh are planning.
- This experience can lead to new objectives, such as finding ways to counteract or dismantle the dragonshard’s influence, or investigating other areas of Sharn that might hold the key to stopping Woe’s machinations.

### Sharn Tension Encounters


Here is a table with some brief encounter ideas for Sharn and related details to help the DM if players investigate further:

| Encounter | Details for DM |
|-|-|  
| A tiefling preacher rants about "end times" while fearful citizens hurry past. | The preacher is a madman named Jorik who claims to receive visions of doom. DC 15 Insight check reveals he seems sincere in his beliefs. |
| Guards question a ragged half-orc about spotting 'Tarks'. | The guards are referring to House Tarkanan agents rumored to be in the area. The half-orc knows nothing. |
| An elf peddles rare demonic tomes from a cart for exorbitant prices. | The elf is a black market dealer named Talian who sells books about devils and demons, including one titled '[[Misc Books and Texts#In the Details An Exploration of Devil Sociology\|In the Details: An Exploration of Devil Sociology]].' |
| A drunk dwarf mutters about the "flame dying out" before being hushed. | He's referring to a secret cult that believes the Silver Flame is fading. DC 13 Persuasion could convince him to share meeting location. |  
| Guards discuss "troubling omens" in hushed tones. | Omens include unnatural fog, aberrant creature sightings, and night terrors afflicting citizens. |
| Strange symbols warn of "ancient lords" and "serpents." | DC 11 Religion or Arcana check identifies them as connected to Overlords of the First Age. |
| An urchin slips a warning about "enemies in masks." | The urchin knows little but has overheard things suggesting shapeshifters or changelings are operating in the city. |
| Cries ring out from a home before a bloodied resident calmly exits. | DC 13 Insight suspects they are under some kind of charm or mind control magic. |
| Guards extinguish blazes sparked by strange green flames. | The flames radiate conjuration magic and have appeared in seemingly random spots around the city. |

### Session 1 Lead-in


 Dried blood cakes Khorvaire like topsoil, giving way to the blooming flowers of greed, selfishness, and violence. Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. 

102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. 

Blood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.

Powerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. 

House Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.

With no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.

Then 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. 

The signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.

Still, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.

Our story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. 

Deckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.

The smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.

A tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. 

Bjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?

- DOES KNOW & WON'T GIVE UP: Bosses name, anything that humiliates him, anything that can be directly used against the clan.
- DOES NOT KNOW: Castar's motives, deeper questions about the workings of the clan.

_Plot Information_
- Seeks to bring the town under Boromar control through protection racket and intimidation. Reason clan wants to control Shavalant:
	- Water tower is a unique piece of magitech - knowledge of workings could be worth good money
	- Shavalant is along a commonly traveled road - traveling merchants can be easily extorted.


Person 2: Orc 1 & 3

- Dumb and strong. Will not succumb to physical torture, can be easily tricked into giving up information.
- DO KNOW: they were told to 'keep an eye' on Garhorn.
- DO NOT KNOW: Much else. Basic info about the clan.

_Plot Information_

- Typical brutes, low knowledge of clan workings, low knowledge of current job. Loyal to Halak Boromar, were sent along with Garhorn as Halak's way of keeping an eye on things.
- Many such 'guards' were sent along with Castar's men as a result of the inner conflict of the Clan

Person 3: [[Its Kismet|Kismet]]

- Will find a way to convince the PCs to have their fates read.
- Appears as small graying half-elf woman, acts a bit crazy.

Person 5: Chewy

- The Kobold that was covered in oil in session 2 that escaped and was captured by the gang members. Will be very scared.
- DOES KNOW: SotDoK is a fairly new group put together by Brains in an effort to create his own clan, he was always vague about their rituals, kept information to himself. Demanded a lot from the members.
- DOES NOT KNOW: Who Woe is, why they attacked the airship, why they took Marsh.

Raided the boromar gang campsite
- Found Garhorn's ledger, his intel on Baelen ir'Torn, and his map of Khorvaire, in addition to loot listed below.
- Killed Orc 1 and Orc 3 during the encounter.
- They healed and interrogated the captured Kobold, who told them that the Sons of the Daughter of Khyber were a very make-shift and disorganized cult. He also told them Brains struck a deal with Woe to take down the airship in session 1 so they could get more people to sacrifice, though he didn't know Woe's name.
	- The party let the kobold escape.
- Let Garhorn and his blink dog Flicker leave alive, along with one of their horses (the one that demanded carrots from Geralt when he used speak with animals).
	- The party did not search Garhorn, he left with his sending stone and special lockpicking set.
	- Garhorn will travel to the closest known Boromar safe house and get aid. He used his sending stone to contact his superior and order a hit out on the party. He will also return to Shavalant with more gang members and burn the town to the ground since they aided the party.
	- PCs took the remaining horse from camp (the one that was very thankful for the apple Geralt fed it).

The party returned to Shavalant soon after, and went to talk to Miri.

- Miri was concerned at how they handled it, though she was grateful they helped at all.
	- She is afraid that Garhorn will send for more muscle and come back to burn the town to the ground.
	- She relays to the party that she spoke with her mentor Aeren d'Cannith, and that he needs the names of the party so he can aid them through the Sharn gates once they arrive.
	- Miri also told the PCs that he was intrigued about Geralt's steelhardt schematics, though he wouldn't reveal anything over sending stone.
	- (Aeren will recognize Geralt's last name and will begin looking into his family further, suspecting they are connected to House Cannith's involvement in the Day of Mourning.)
- Sheriff Cromley showed up at Miri's workshop during this conversation, very irate. He asked the party to leave, and payed for another horse they could ride out of town.
	- He is concered for the same reasons Miri is, though he is less grateful towards the party than her.
- The PCs stopped by Prissy's apothecary on the way out, and she gave the party a potion of fire breath and potion of growth as thanks for delivering news of her son's passing (which happened in session 1).
- They read the intel letter concernig Baelen and his group of CotSF guards and planned on heading to Sharn, with a possible detour to Castle Arakhain (AKA "The Lighthouse") to investigate a potential lead on the purple crystal he has, hoping to discover more about Woe.

During first day of travel they completed the "It's Kismet" encounter.
- Helped her repair her wagon using some glue she had.
- She announced herself as a seer and offered palm readings. Things got weird fast and she gave their fate readings detailed in the encounter.
- The party left shortly after, a bit freaked out.
- Bjorn was less jolted by the encounter, due to his mother being the Stormpeak Clan's seer.

Found the remains of the skirmish between Baelen's guards and the LoD ambush.
- Found the initial clues about the ambush, investigated the scene a bit.
- Bjorn spotted the path leading towards the creek bed that contains the dead Knight Templar.

- Goliath Barbarian
- Lawful Neutral
### Background
- Soldier
- Was the Chieftain of the Stormpeak clan in the Graywall Mountains of Droaam
- Was usurped by his younger brother, Hrothgar.
### Backstory
Bjorn-Ulfr was born into the Goliath tribe known as the Stormpeak Clan, a hardy and fierce group that roamed the rugged mountains of the northern lands. From a young age, Bjorn-Ulfr showed signs of great strength and resilience, surpassing even the most seasoned warriors in the tribe. His towering stature and relentless determination earned him the respect of his people, and it wasn't long before he was seen as a natural leader.

As he grew older, Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership qualities became more apparent, and it was clear that he would one day become the chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan. Under his guidance, the clan flourished, becoming a force to be reckoned with in the harsh wilderness. Bjorn-Ulfr's sense of honor and loyalty was unwavering, and he made it a priority to protect his people from external threats while fostering a strong sense of unity among his tribe.

Bjorn-Ulfr had a younger brother, Hrothgar, who was also a formidable warrior but lacked the same moral compass as his older sibling. As the years passed, Hrothgar's ambition and lust for power grew. He became increasingly envious of Bjorn-Ulfr's status and the adoration he received from the clan. Hrothgar's jealousy festered, and he began plotting to usurp his brother's position as chieftain.

One fateful night, Hrothgar betrayed his brother, orchestrating a coup against Bjorn-Ulfr and seizing control of the clan through treachery and deceit. Bjorn-Ulfr, who had always been trusting and believed in the inherent goodness of his people, was taken by surprise. Defeated and cast out by his own brother, Bjorn-Ulfr was left to wander the harsh wilderness alone.

With the betrayal still fresh in his heart, Bjorn-Ulfr embarked on a path of self-discovery and redemption. He channeled his anger, pain, and loss into becoming an even more formidable warrior, delving into the ways of the barbarian to hone his rage. As he roamed the wild, he formed new alliances and built a following of loyal outcasts and like-minded individuals who sought justice and vengeance against the treacherous Hrothgar.

Bjorn-Ulfr's ultimate goal became to confront his brother and restore the rightful order within the Stormpeak Clan. The memory of the betrayal fueled his determination to bring Hrothgar to justice, not only for his own sake but to reclaim the honor and legacy of their people. Under Bjorn-Ulfr's leadership, his ragtag group of followers would stop at nothing to right the wrongs committed by his own flesh and blood and restore his place as the true chieftain of the Stormpeak Clan.

## (deceased) Sylas Stormshadow
### Race & Class
- Half-Elf Warlock
- Chaotic Neutral
### Background
- Sage
- Born in the Sharn Underground to an Elvish scholar father and Human merchant mother
- Warlock of the Traveler
### Backstory
Sylas Stormshadow, the enigmatic half-elf warlock of chaotic neutral alignment, has a backstory filled with mystery and the enigmatic presence of the Traveler.

Born to a human mother and an elven father, Sylas's life was marked by a turbulent blend of cultures and a thirst for power. Here is his revised backstory:

Sylas was born in the bustling coastal city of Sharn, where humans and elves coexisted in an uneasy alliance. His father, a reclusive elven scholar, had a fascination with forbidden knowledge and the enigmatic aspects of magic. Sylas's mother was a human merchant who embraced the chaos of the city's underbelly. From her, Sylas learned his first taste of anarchy and rebellion.

From an early age, Sylas displayed an insatiable curiosity for the arcane, an unquenchable thirst for power, and an innate ability to bend others to his will. Though concerned about his son's choices, his father could not deny the potential within him and reluctantly taught Sylas the basics of eldritch magic. Sylas quickly surpassed his father's teachings and delved into darker tomes and rituals, seeking the forbidden secrets that eldritch beings held.

One fateful night, during an illicit ritual deep in the city's labyrinthine sewers, Sylas made a pact with the mysterious and enigmatic Traveler. The Traveler granted Sylas otherworldly powers in exchange for his servitude and adherence to its unpredictable whims. Its motives were always veiled in mystery, and its presence brought chaos and intrigue to Sylas's life.

The Traveler's influence transformed Sylas into a warlock with the power to manipulate time, reality, and fate. But in return, the Traveler would randomly manifest its presence, whisking Sylas away to alternate realities and planes, often leaving him to navigate unforeseen challenges.
