**ai**: Based on the **Session Summaries** (specifically the aftermath of Session 23) and the **Plot Web**, here is a comprehensive plan for **Session 24**.

### **Session Theme: Aftermath & Revelation**
The party has just defeated a major boss (Vorak) and cleansed a significant NPC (Varyn). The adrenaline is fading, and now they must process heavy lore drops, examine a campaign-critical artifact, and pivot toward the next major arc: **Bjorn’s Homecoming / The Stormpeak Clan.**

---

### **1. Immediate Aftermath: The Peak of Byeshk**
**Scene:** The dust settles on the destroyed side of Varyn’s home. Vorak is gone, dissolved into rage energy.
*   **Varyn "The Valiant" (Now Lucid):**
    *   **Draven’s Closure:** Varyn is no longer delusional. He should have a heartfelt moment with Draven. He should apologize for failing to protect him and for not being able to restore his memories fully. He validates Draven as the true "Knight of the North."
    *   **Nyx’s Warning:** Reiterate the warning he gave Nyx in private: "To find her daughter she may lose something just as precious." (Foreshadowing the choice between Elix and the mission/party).
    *   **Geralt’s Curse:** Confirm that the successful use/calibration of the **Legacy Stone** has halted the corruption of Geralt's mind (or bought him significant time). The stone is now primed for **Hrothgar**.

### **2. The Artifact: The Steelhardt Prototype**
Lox picked up the **Steelhardt Prototype** from Vorak’s remains. This is a massive plot item.
*   **Investigation:** When they inspect it (Arcana/Investigation checks):
    *   It looks ancient but advanced.
    *   **Key Detail:** It contains slots for *two* dragonshards. One slot has a residue of a **Khyber** shard (darkness/impiety), and the other a **Siberys** shard (light/divinity).
    *   **Lore Connection:** Refer to the **Plot Web (Geralt Wolfsbane)** section. This confirms Geralt’s parents' theory: A soul transfer requires *balance*. Vorak went mad because he lacked the Siberys aspect. Forge (the PC) is sane because he accidentally had both (Siberys in his chest, Khyber from Lick's father's FKD fragment nearby when he died).
*   **Geralt’s Realization:** Geralt recognizes the craftsmanship. It matches the "cool designs" he stole from his father's desk as a child.

### **3. The Next Objective: Stormpeak**
Now that the Legacy Stone is calibrated, the target is **Hrothgar** (Bjorn’s brother).
*   **The Stakes:** Hrothgar has the **Etherseraph** (Varyn's blade) and a **Fractured Khyber Dragonshard (FKD) Fragment**.
*   **Varyn’s Intel:** Varyn cannot travel with them (he is too weak/old/broken), but he can tell them:
    *   Hrothgar is letting the shard consume him.
    *   The **Etherseraph** is the key to lighting the way to the Silver Flame (and clearing the Mourning), so retrieving it is essential for the global plot.
*   **Travel Logistics:** They are at the Byeshk Mountains. They need to get to the **Icehorn Mountains** (Bjorn's home). This is a long journey.
    *   *Option:* Do they return to **Shavalant** first?
        *   **Reason to go:** **Forge** is with Aeren in Shavalant. The party *needs* Aeren to analyze the Steelhardt Prototype properly, and they need to pick up Forge.
        *   **Reason to go:** Miri is there. It's a safe base.

### **4. Downtime / Roleplay Moments (The Descent)**
As they descend the mountain or camp for the night:
*   **Lox & Nyx:** Discuss the revelation from Mordakhesh that **Elix is alive**.
    *   *Conflict:* Lox knows Mordakhesh is a dark entity (or at least suspicious). Nyx is desperate. Do they trust the source?
*   **Bjorn:** He is now the focus. The party needs to ask him about the Stormpeak Clan. What defenses does Hrothgar have? Who is loyal to Bjorn?
*   **Geralt:** He just helped destroy his parents' killer. How does he feel?

### **5. Encounter Idea: The Road to Shavalant**
Since Session 23 was a heavy boss fight, Session 24 can be lighter on combat, but a skirmish keeps the pace up.
*   **The Interception:** As they leave the Nameless Town/Mountain base.
*   **Enemies:** **The Lords of Dust** (Minions of Mordakhesh or Rak Tulkesh).
    *   *Why?* They sensed Vorak's defeat. They know the party has the Legacy Stone.
    *   *Type:* Fiends, or perhaps corrupted wildlife (Rageblight remnants).
*   **Alternative Social Encounter:** **The Nameless.** The people of the town at the base of the mountain worship Varyn. Seeing the party return alive (and Varyn's house destroyed/altered) might cause a religious panic or awe. Draven might have to address them as the "Knight of the North."

### **Checklist for Session 24**
*   [ ] **Resolve Geralt's Curse:** Confirm he is safe for now.
*   [ ] **Identify the Steelhardt:** Connect it to Forge’s backstory and Geralt’s parents.
*   [ ] **Set Destination:** Likely Shavalant (to regroup with Forge/Aeren) -> Then Stormpeak.
*   [ ] **Loot Distribution:** Did they loot Vorak? (Any rage-infused items? Or just the prototype?)
*   [ ] **Level Up?** They just defeated a major arc boss. Check if they are due for Level 8.

### **DM Note on "Forge"**
Since Forge was absent in Session 23, the party traveling to **Shavalant** is the perfect narrative bridge to bring him back in. You can say he has been working with Aeren on "Delamane" (the combat robot requested in Session 19) and studying the lore while the party was climbing the mountain. When they arrive with the Steelhardt Prototype, it gives Forge a massive "Eureka!" moment for his own character arc.
