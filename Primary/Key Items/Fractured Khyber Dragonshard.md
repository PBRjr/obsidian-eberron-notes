### Description

- A shattered [[Dragonshards#^023b44|Khyber Dragonshard]] the size of a fist, covered in ancient draconic runes with a faint glow pulsing from within
- The gem is warm to the touch and has a gentle pulsing vibration.
- It has 4 visible chunks taken out of it, which clearly bore additional runes that are now missing.

### History

- As a part of the ancient ritual involving the sacrifice of the Couatl, Rak Tulkesh's avatar was separated from his demi planes, exposing a vulnerability. 
- Beaten by the ancient dragons of [[The Chamber]], his aspect was sealed away in this Dragonshard.
- To keep it out of the hands of the [[Lords of Dust]], it was shattered, its fragments spread across the world.

### Powers/Abilities

- The Dragonshard contains the fragmented aspect of Rak Tulkesh.
- After restoring at least 1 shard, and focusing on it for an hour, a character may communicate with the aspect telepathically.
- The aspect will not originally know its origin, but will remember after being joined with at least 2 shards.

### Location

- The main gem is currently where ever the PC's find it
- Lick: 1 Shard before airship crash
- [[Woe]]: 1 Shard before airship crash
- Last 2 shards?? Morgrave University?

### Interacting With It

- Touching a shard allows for telepathic communication with the Aspect after at least 1 hour of focusing on it, so long as at least 1 fragment has been restored.
- It will remember its origin after 2 shards, and begin to manipulate the party to find the rest.

### Hook
- The Silver Flame is constantly searching for it, even ransacking the Players quarters if they find out about it.
- [[Woe]] seeks to increase his power using the shards
- [[Mordakesh]] seeks to transform Woe into a physical avatar for Rak Tulkesh without his knowledge using the shards.
