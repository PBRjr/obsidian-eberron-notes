> "Dragon's Blood is a magical phenomenon unlike any other. It enables the user to tap into a crude, unstable form of the primal forces of magic. But like handling raw elemental forces, the risks far outweigh the fleeting benefits. This drug not only wreaks havoc on the user's physical form but also destabilizes the very magical essence of their being. The uncontrolled magical outbursts are akin to trying to direct a thunderstorm with a tin roof - unpredictable, chaotic, and more often than not, disastrous."

Dragon Blood, also known as Blood or Heat, is an illegal substance commonly found in the lower levels of [[Sharn]]. In its raw form, it is a thick, iridescent liquid that shifts color in the light, reminiscent of an oil slick or a soap bubble. It is typically consumed by dropping the liquid onto the tongue, where it absorbs quickly into the bloodstream, causing an immediate and potent effect.

Users often describe the initial effects as a sensation of warmth spreading throughout the body, a quickening of the senses, and an unexplainable feeling of being deeply connected to the mystical weave of magic that permeates the world. Regular users become addicted, not just to the drug's effects but also to the feeling of power and the illusions of insight into the magical world around them.

However, the drug's long-term effects can be devastating. Prolonged use of Dragon's Blood results in physical deterioration and mental instability, as the body struggles to cope with the sudden influx of magical energy. It can lead to hallucinations, erratic behavior, and in the worst cases, wild magical outbursts.

The following is a table of random magical effects Dragon's Blood might trigger. The effects of each last for 1 minute, or 10 rounds, unless specified otherwise. 

1. The user emits a bright light in a 30-foot radius.
2. The next spell cast by the user targets a random creature within range, but does not use a spell slot. If the spell has an AOE, it is cast centered on a random creature in range.
3. The user vomits relentlessly, losing their next turn and gaining 1 point of exhaustion.
4. The user can only speak in haiku.
5. The user becomes enlarged, but gains a level of exhaustion once the effect wears off.
6. The user is under the effect of the invisibility spell for the duration.
7. The user gains a flying speed equal to their walking speed. If the user already has a flying speed, it doubles.
8. The user immediately casts Fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on themselves.
9. For the next minute, all the user's melee attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage, both to the target and the user.
10. The user is affected as if by the Polymorph spell, transformed into a sheep for the duration.
