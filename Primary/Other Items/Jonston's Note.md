This piece of worn parchment has obviously seen the wear-and-tear of an active lifestyle. If Jon was killed it also has some blood smears on it.

> Dear Jonny,
> 
> I miss you so much since you left town. The house feels empty without your laughter filling it up. I hope you are doing okay on your travels. 
> 
> Things have been odd around here lately. The animals have been riled up, especially at night. Folks say they hear weird noises coming from the Whitehorn Woods. I'm sure it's nothing to worry over, but it would be nice to have you home. 
> 
> I'm going to bake your favorite blueberry pie for when you visit. I can't wait to see your smiling face and hear about your adventures. Please be careful and come back soon. You're always in my prayers.  
> 
> Love,
> Ma
