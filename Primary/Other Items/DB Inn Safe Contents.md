## Incriminating Documents
To whom it may concern,

After careful consideration of the recent events and the opportunities they present, I have decided to move forward with the Mourn weapon production. Our connections within House Tarkanan shall remain discreet, and I assure you that our transactions will be conducted with the utmost secrecy.

The newly produced prototypes have proven quite functional. I am convinced that our collaboration will not only be profitable but also lead to significant advancements in arcane weaponry.

Best regards,

Marix d'Cannith
