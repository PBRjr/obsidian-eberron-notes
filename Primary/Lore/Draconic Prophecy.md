> The falling of a tree, the flap of a butterflies wings, the whispers of wind in man's ear. It is not known what drove the universe to create such an eternal living document. That's what unique about chaos - sometimes, things just happen.

## Functionality
The prophecy isn't a document that tells of all that will be. Its more like an observation of specific circumstances that give a series of if-then statements in regard to the universe. Only an ancient or powerful being may have the knowledge to interpret these signs into any useful knowledge.

- [[The Chamber]] actively works to use the prophecy to engineer favorable results in the world.
- The [[Lords of Dust]] actively work to use the prophecy to free their [[Overlords]].
