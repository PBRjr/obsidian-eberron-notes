The age of demons exposed the world to the power of the Overlords. Great, terrifying, and nearly unstoppable, a single overlord freed of its bonds can assert its domain across an entire country. 

The [[Dragons of Argonnessen]], combined with the full force of the [[Couatl]], waged a war against the [[Overlords]]. Weaving the threads of the [[Draconic Prophecy]], the Couatl sacrificed their collective life force to form the Silver Flame, forever imprisoning the Overlords by separating their consciousness from the power of their Heart Demi planes.

Though they can be imprisoned, the Overlords can never be defeated. In modern times, with the Last War's destruction threatening to plunge the entirety of Khorvaire into chaos, the [[Lords of Dust]] threaten to use the prophecy to break their lords bonds.

Knowing that to allow this war to continue would be to release the most dangerous of the Children of Khyber, the Dragons of Argonnessen decided to use their ancient magic to stifle the life of [[Cyre]], knowing it would bring an end to the Last War and disrupt the Overlords' plans.

Should a similar situation arise in the future, [[The Chamber]] will not hesitate to use their terrible and awesome power again to bring stability and maintain order in the face of absolute destruction.
