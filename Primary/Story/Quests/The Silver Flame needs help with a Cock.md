While on their travels, the party encounters a small group of [[Church of the Silver Flame|Knights of the Silver Flame]]. They are traveling with a Friar on a mission to convert people to the cause. 

The party encounters this small group while they are on the hunt for a cockatrice, which has been troubling local townsfolk, in hopes of earning their trust and appreciation. 

## Hook
- The Knights request aid in tracking down the cockatrice, and promise a reward if they are successful
- To aid in this request, the knights gift the party a single **Potion of Basilisk Bile**, which can reverse petrification

## Quest
- *Kill the cockatrice, return with proof.*
- The knights will part way with the party, informing them to meet back at the closest village/town in the case that they are successful, for their reward. 
- After tracking a blood trail suspected to be the dinner of the cockatrice, the party discovers 3 black bears - a mother and her two cubs - feasting on the small creature.

## Rewards
- 2d6-4d6 x10 Galifars (negotiated)
- 2d4 healing potions
- **Letter of Light**: Allows for free board at Silver Flame churches.
