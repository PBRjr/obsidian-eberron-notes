## Overview

This is the overarching conflict that is spurring on events within [[Eberron]], though most aren't aware of that. There is an eternal conflict between the [[Lords of Dust]] and Dragons of [[The Chamber]], each subtly manipulating events in Khorvaire to influence the [[Draconic Prophecy]] in their favor. The PCs will realize their actions may have unwittingly played into this invisible war.

## Revelation

- The [[Boromar Clan]] power struggle could have been influenced by either faction seeking control over Sharn.

- [[House Tarkanan|House Tarkanan's]] mourning weapon deals may have been orchestrated or disrupted by one side or the other.
   
- The [[Church of the Silver Flame|Silver Flame]] [[Brass Compass|compass]] incident has hallmarks of a complex scheme by the Chamber. But could the Lords have allowed or encouraged it?
   
- Vaults unearthed in Xen'drik seem tied to tools used in the eternal war. But which faction seeks to claim them?

- Mysterious letters keep making their ways into the hands of those with power. Were these strategic moves of the Chamber, or the manipulations from the Lords of Dust?

- Prophetic dreams foretell of Overlords' bonds weakening. Are the PCs inadvertently serving the Lords of Dust? Or is this a Chamber deception? Perhaps a warning from the Silver Flame herself?
