Dried blood cakes Khorvaire like topsoil, giving way to the blooming flowers of greed, selfishness, and violence. Though it ended over 2 years ago, the effects of the Last War still linger, like scars on an old, beaten down body. 

102 years ago the Kingdom of Galifar fell into a brutal civil war. Five nations once united, became fractured. Their leaders - the Children of the late King Jarot - battled for ultimate control. 

Blood was spilled, villages were ransacked, entire cities came crashing down. Bodies piled high, the death count reaching the hundred thousands. Years later, and most couldn't even remember what they were fighting for - dying for.

Powerful dynastic guilds dominated the political and economic landscape. Unbound from any particular nation, and identified by their dragonmarks, each house played their own role in the war, often serving the needs of more than one side at a time. 

House Cannith - the house of creation - invented the Warforged, a race of magically imbued sentient beings designed to fight for whoever could pay for them. Created of wood and metal, they were excellent soldiers, driven by one purpose - to follow orders.

With no end in sight, the war raged on. The five nations became more entrenched than ever, reaching stalemates that might never have been broken. House Cannith became the richest and most influential family on Khorvaire.

Then 4 years ago, the great nation of Cyre was destroyed in a magical calamity known as the Day of Mourning. The country was swallowed by a magical fog, destroying or permanently altering everyone and everything inside. To this day no one knows what caused it, and no nation or organization has claimed responsibility. 

The signing of the Treaty of Thronehold brought an end to the last war, and with it spread thousands of Cyran refugees throughout the remaining nations. Warforged soldiers, once codified in an obvious purpose, were left adrift, suddenly sent into the world, expected to 'find their way' on their own.

Still, through this unsteady peace, tensions loom. Increasing conflict between great houses and criminal organizations has everyone on edge. No matter the outward confidence portrayed by their leaders, every nation - every people - is feeling it. Only one thing is for certain: something grave is on the horizon. Something that could leave the world fractured once again, perhaps forever.

Our story doesn't begin at the scale of continents, or nations, or even cities. No, our story begins with an airship, surrounded by a ring of elemental energy, traveling towards the City of Towers. 

Deckhands work quietly, doing their assigned tasks with little distraction, content in knowing their next meal comes after their day's work is complete. A navigator stands grasping the wheel, located next to a large purple crystal built into a metal foundation at the rear of the boat.

The smell of cooked food and sloshed ale permeates the ship from below decks, accompanied by laughter, shouts, and the occasional shanty - celebrations of a finished delivery tour. Relief is on everyone's mind as they think of the homes and family they'll soon return to.

A tall and rugged man with pale blue skin and a bald head stands at portside, leaning on a splintered wooden railing, staring out at a falling sun. Its the start of the winter months, and the evening wind is cold and harsh, cracking the flag of the ship's trading company back and forth. 

Bjorn, as you take one more look towards the bleeding evening sky, would you please describe your character, as well as what he might be reflecting on in this moment?
