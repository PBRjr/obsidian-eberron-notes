## Key points
 - Houses and businesses are loosely grouped together. Most townsfolk have some sort of farmland or collection of livestock. A large light metal water tower covered with magical runes towers over the village, sticking out like a sore thumb.
 
 - Small livestock and farming town that irrigates their crops using complicated magical pipe system
	 - Teleports water into large water tower and distributes it to the people, livestock, and crops.

- Mostly human populous, some gnomes and dwarves.
	- **Jonston** and **Prissy Marsh** are the only tieflings here.

- See [[Whitehorn Wood]] sidequest
