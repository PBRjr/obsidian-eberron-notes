## Concept
- A diverse, eclectic district home to immigrants and exotic cultures. Known for nightlife, black markets, and organized crime.

## Description
> Hulking towers carved to resemble dragons loom over the eclectic buildings of the Dragoneyes District. Even in the early hours, people fill the streets - revelers laughing and stumbling between taverns, travelers hauling exotic wares, lurkers eyeing marks from darkened alleys. Flickering lights and ruckus spill from cabarets and gambling dens, beckoning indulgence. Down winding side streets, robed figures dart furtively toward secret dealings. Amid the constant movement, your presence draws little attention beyond the occasional sidelong glance, as if the crowd shares an unspoken code of discretion in this neighborhood where fortune and peril often go hand-in-hand.
