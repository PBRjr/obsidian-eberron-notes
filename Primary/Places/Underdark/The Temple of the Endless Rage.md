# Concept (pg. 143)
- Over 100,000 years ago, at the end of the age of demons, the Couatl made their sacrifice and separated the [[Overlords]]' source of power from the material plane, weakening and trapping their avatars in magical prisons around the world. 
- This is the prison of **[[Rak Tulkesh|Rak Tulkesh's]]** power, which is useless without an avatar.

# Description
> As you step past the stone columns that mark the entrance, the world behind you fades away, replaced by a hushed reverence for something incomprehensibly ancient. The air here is warm, and as it feels like pine needles as it rushes past you. It smells of wet stone and dank moss. 

>  A bright, silver fire emanates from a pulsing purple gem, illuminating the temple from the far side of you, casting you in dim light. Thick columns of cracked marble line this place in multiple rows, acting as supports that hold up the vaulted ceiling. Many runes have been chiseled out of the columns, but the wear of time has made them almost completely unreadable. All you can make out is "Temple - Endless - Rage".

> Rows of well kept wooden pews line both sides of a walkway that leads to the flame. As you take in the vastness of this temple, its centerpiece demands your attention. An enormous pit sits 15ft in front of you. Its depth so vast and dark it swallows any light that dare enter it.

> It has a sort of alluring pull to it that gets stronger the closer you get. Almost as if its calling to you, reaching out to your very soul with a single word... "CLOSER".

# Notable Locations
- The Endless: The pit that sits in the middle of this timeless temple is actually the largest entrance to *Shavarath*, the demiplane of **Rak Tulkesh**. Though its not large enough to allow the return of his Avatar, it still exudes an immensely powerful influence over the land nearby.
