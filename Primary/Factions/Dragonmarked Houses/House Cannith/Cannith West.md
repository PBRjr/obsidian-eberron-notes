House Cannith West is one of the twelve noble houses of the nation of Cyre in the fictional world of Eberron. It is a prominent house dedicated to the creation and innovation of magical items and constructs. House Cannith West specializes in the development of warforged, which are sentient constructs used as soldiers and laborers.

The house is known for its advanced workshops and factories, where skilled artificers and engineers work tirelessly to produce magical items and constructs for various purposes. House Cannith West has a strong presence in [[Cyre]], with its headquarters located in the city of [[Fairhaven]].

However, during the [[Last War]]  Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysmic event known as the [[Day of Mourning]]. As a result, House Cannith West lost its headquarters and much of its resources.

In the aftermath of the Day of Mourning, House Cannith West has been struggling to rebuild its operations and regain its former glory. They have established smaller workshops and outposts throughout [[Khorvaire]], seeking opportunities to regain their prominence in the creation and sale of magical items.

Despite their setbacks, House Cannith West remains a formidable force in Eberron's economy and continues to play a significant role in shaping the world through their technological advancements.
