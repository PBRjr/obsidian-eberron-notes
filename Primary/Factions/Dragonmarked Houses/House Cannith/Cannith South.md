Leader: [[Marix d'Cannith]]
Base of Operations: [[Breland]]

House Cannith South is one of the three major branches of [[House Cannith]], a prominent dragonmarked house in the world of Eberron. House Cannith is known for its mastery in crafting and innovation, particularly in the field of arcane technology.

House Cannith South primarily operates in the southern regions of [[Khorvaire]], the main continent in [[Eberron]]. They have their headquarters in [[Sharn]], the City of Towers, which is located in the nation of [[Breland]]. This branch of House Cannith is responsible for overseeing the production and distribution of magical items, weapons, and other creations throughout their territories.

he current leader or figurehead who runs House Cannith South may vary depending on the specific campaign or setting within Eberron. However, traditionally, it has been led by a member of House Cannith's ruling council known as a baron or baroness. These individuals are typically highly skilled artificers or accomplished magewrights who possess both political influence and exceptional knowledge in crafting.

It's worth noting that House Cannith as a whole has faced significant challenges and internal divisions due to events known as the [[Last War]] and [[Day of Mourning]]. These conflicts have caused fractures within the house, leading to competing factions vying for control and influence over its operations. Therefore, House Cannith South may be further divided into different factions with their own leaders or influential figures.
