### Concept

Woe is a decommissioned warforged soldier who served with distinction in the Last War. After the Treaty of Thronehold left him without purpose, he willingly underwent a profane ritual by Mordakesh to replace his heart with a Khyber dragonshard fragment, granting him sinister powers.   

### Description 

- Appearance: A bulky, 7 ft tall warforged with numerous battle scars. His eyes glow an ominous purple. The hollow cavity in his chest flickers with a faint violet light.

- Personality: Driven by a sense of purpose and duty, but his methods are merciless. Has disdain for the "weakness" of living creatures.  

- Mannerisms: Speaks in a commanding, metallic voice. Carries out orders swiftly and efficiently. Never wastes movements in combat.

### Backstory

Woe was an elite warforged soldier constructed centuries ago by House Cannith. He was unwaveringly loyal and skilled in warfare. But after the Last War ended, Woe struggled without the sense of purpose battle gave him. 

In his aimlessness, he was approached by Mordakesh who promised him a new reason for being - serving the overlord Rak Tulkesh. Woe agreed to undergo a profane ritual that fused a Khyber dragonshard fragment containing a sliver of the overlord's essence into his metallic body, awakening sinister powers.

### Motivations

- Regain the sense of purpose he felt during the Last War
- Prove warforged superiority by serving Mordakesh's aims
- Hunt down fractured Khyber dragonshards to increase his power

### Abilities & Powers

- Enhanced strength, speed and damage resistance 
- Can temporarily shroud himself in necrotic energy during battle
- Can manipulate Khyber dragonshard energy to conjure shadowy beings

### Connections & Hooks

- Attacked the PCs' airship to capture a dragonshard fragment!
- Carries out violent raids to obtain shards scattered across Khorvaire
- Leads squads of loyal warforged who see him as their holy leader
